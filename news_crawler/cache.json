    "content": "BEIJING, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- China has witnessed a continuing downward trend of occupational disease prevalence in the country, with a 40 percent decrease in newly diagnosed occupational disease cases between 2019 and 2022.\nOccupational health occupies a pivotal position in China's broader health strategy, and health risk management is deemed a fundamental measure in preventing and controlling occupational diseases at their source.\nIn this regard, the National Health Commission (NHC) in January 2022 launched a four-year campaign targeting workplaces with excessive dust, toxic chemicals, and noise across the country.\nOver the past two years, a total of 185,000 enterprises have been included in the campaign, of which 71,000 have already implemented measures to address relevant risks, according to NHC data released at a press conference held on Friday in Beijing.\nAccording to NHC official Wang Jiandong, the commission has also established a key laboratory for dust hazard protection to develop critical technologies for occupational disease prevention and control.\nChina's fight for workers' health goes beyond traditional occupational maladies. Equal emphasis has been placed on tackling emerging risks such as unhealthy work practices and excessive job-related stress.\nStarting from 2019, China's occupational disease and health risk monitoring system has been covering all types of illnesses. Under this system, 95 percent of county-level regions and 314,000 enterprises, especially smaller businesses, are being monitored.\nChina has formulated work-related mental health promotion guidelines and tailored guidelines to improve occupational health for key groups like medical personnel, nuclear power station workers, and firefighting and rescue personnel.\nAdditionally, targeted monitoring and intervention for people in high-risk professions are underway in the country, and efforts have been made to raise public awareness of occupational health through various activities.\n\"Promoting occupational health in China requires joint efforts from the government, employers and individual workers,\" said Wang.\nAnother element of China's continuous endeavors to address occupational diseases is the promotion of \"healthy enterprises,\" which offer improved working conditions and environments.\nBased on data from the NHC, about 19,000 enterprises nationwide have been recognized as \"healthy enterprises.\" In certain regions, such as Hubei and Sichuan, such enterprises are eligible for favorable policies, including lower premiums for work-related injury insurance.\n\"Further efforts will be undertaken to prompt all regions in China to introduce more incentive and reward policies for the establishment of 'healthy enterprises,' aiming to benefit a larger workforce,\" Wang said.  ■"

However, Washington's recent rhetoric has morphed it into yet another Sinophobic catchphrase.\nBEIJING, April 11 (Xinhua) -- In view of China's rise to the top of the global car export market, Washington's response has been marked by a palpable unease.\nRather than addressing underlying issues with domestic competitiveness head-on, U.S. policymakers and their allies in the media have resorted to protectionist rhetoric, invoking the convenient but dubious theory of \"Chinese overcapacity\" in the clean energy sector, particularly in electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and solar cells.\nThis tactic isn't new. It reflects a longstanding pattern of politicizing economic and trade issues to suit the U.S. agenda: thwarting the ascent of Chinese rivals to preserve the longstanding monopoly of the United States and its Western allies in the global economic hierarchy.\nThe concept of overcapacity is deeply rooted in economic theory. However, Washington's recent rhetoric has morphed it into yet another Sinophobic catchphrase, with an oversimplified idea that Chinese goods production in the clean energy sector exceeds domestic demand, resulting in a global overcapacity concern.\nA fundamental fallacy of such \"overcapacity\" accusations is that contrary to an \"overcapacity problem,\" the clean energy sector is struggling to meet global demand amidst urgent climate change concerns and widespread efforts towards energy transition.\nAt the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.\nIn 2023, a year with a record high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.\nAs China transitions to high-quality development, its \"new three\" industries -- electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic products -- are highly sought after globally. They support countries in achieving green, low-carbon transformation and sustainable development, fostering global economic growth.\nWhile China's clean energy vehicle industry has made significant strides forward, the United States perceives heightened competition from China in high-end industries and value chains. Furthermore, they fear that their traditional technological monopolies, particularly in developing nations, may face erosion due to China's progress.\nThis zero-sum mindset fails to recognize the potential advantages of cooperation and collective progress. Rather than perceiving China's advancements as a threat and rolling out more protectionist policies, Washington and its allies should join China for constructive dialogue and cooperation to tackle common challenges like climate change and sustainable development.\nIf history is any guide, protectionism isn't answer to the economic woes of the United States and the West. As Bloomberg recently argued, despite implementing steel protectionist measures over the past decade, Washington has failed to prevent the decline in employment within the U.S. metal manufacturing industry.\nWhat is worse, these measures have increased costs across other sectors of the U.S. economy, diminishing industry competitiveness. If extended to the new energy industry, such policies would further weaken Washington's ability to address climate change.\nGary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has recently warned that whether it is in terms of \"decoupling\" or \"de-risking,\" it is a sign of Washington's shift toward deepening protectionism. Ultimately, it is the interests of American companies and people that suffer.\nClinging to obsolete protectionist strategies hampers global progress and sustains a cycle of distrust and rivalry. On the contrary, embracing an inclusive approach that recognizes China's contributions and aims for shared development and prosperity offers the potential for more fruitful outcomes for all stakeholders in the global economy.■"

Living in Yuhu village at the foot of the Yulong Snow Mountain, He Jielin has witnessed the changes in this ancient Naxi village.\nFrom the 1980s to 1990s, He Jielin and his wife could only live off the land. Like other villagers, the couple made a living by cutting wood, picking medicinal materials and digging sand, which resulted in great damages to the forest and the environment. However, people in the village remained poor.\nIn 2004, as the village started to develop tourism, He Jielin began to raise horses and cattle, founded home inns, and gradually, his living condition was improved.\nIn June 2020, He Jielin renovated his old residence, turning it into the village's first museum on Naxi ethnic culture. Tourists were attracted to his museum to experience various activities related with local culture.\nAfter studying in South Korea, He Jielin's daughter He Yuyue also joined the family business, running the museum together with his father.\n\"My father knows a lot about the Naxi ethnic culture, which attracted many tourists. I am also learning hard, so that I could spread the culture just like my father,\" said He Yuyue. Meanwhile, she also shares her daily life on social media in an effort to attract more young visitors.\nCurrently, the cultural museum of He's family has become a must-see attraction for tourists at Yuhu village. The father and the daughter hope they can earn 300,000 yuan (about 41,452 U.S. dollars) this year.

The craft was included in the national intangible cultural heritage list in 2008.\nDuan Jianjun, 51, is a national representative inheritor of Horinger paper-cutting. Since 1994, Duan has been engaged in the protection work of Horinger paper-cutting techniques by collecting dictations from elderly people to record paper-cutting instructions and patterns. His work has brought many endangered skills and a large number of precious patterns back to life.\nIn recent years, with the support of local authorities, Duan established an institute for the sake of popularizing Horinger paper-cutting. He has also set up paper-cutting courses in schools to attract young people's attention. \"Paper-cutting is an art coming from our life, and it would be better passed on by serving people,\" Duan said.

    "content": "BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has clinched the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, announced that his campaign had raised 50.5 million U.S. dollars at a major fundraiser in Florida last week.\nThis figure broke the record of 25 million dollars in fundraising in a single political event set by incumbent President Joe Biden, a Democrat.\nFor a long time, money has been the dominant factor in American elections, and whoever raises more money has a greater chance to win. The power of capital permeates and affects all aspects of American society through political power, forming an \"American democracy\" that is very much dependent on money.\nIn recent years, the cost of elections in the United States has skyrocketed, and money and politics have become more closely intertwined.\nThe total spending of the 2020 U.S. election was as high as 14 billion dollars, twice that of 2016, with 6.6 billion dollars spent on the presidential election and more than 7 billion dollars on the Congressional elections, according to statistics from the Center for Responsive Politics.\nSome American research institutions predict that 2024 will be the most expensive election cycle in American history, with candidates spending more than 10 billion dollars on political advertising alone.\nThe financial threshold for participating in elections is getting increasingly higher.\nAlthough people have the right to vote, they cannot exert a real influence over politics, which makes the \"free election\" that American democracy claims an empty slogan.\n\"The Irony of Democracy: An Uncommon Introduction to American Politics,\" co-authored by Louis Schubert, Thomas R. Dye and Harmon Zeigler, argues that the American people no longer believe that the government serves the common good, and most people think that a few large interest groups control the American political system, and often neglect the public interest to serve their own interests.\nThe intensification of partisan rivalry is an important factor driving rising election costs.\nIn recent years, American society has become increasingly polarized and so has public opinion. The two major political parties and their supporters compete for votes in an extremely fierce manner.\nTo \"buy\" the political power that will dominate resource allocation in the future, additional bets have been continuously added, thus pushing up campaign costs.\nPoliticians are particularly good at turning social tensions, which involve issues of climate change, abortion, trade, immigration and other aspects of the economy and people's livelihood, into tools to win over public opinion.\nWith more and more issues involved in party rivalry, the two parties are under increased pressure to invest more money in policy-making and advertising to win public opinion.\nIn addition, in the context of intensified party rivalry, the cost of candidates attacking and slandering each other and the two parties fighting each other is also high.\nJapan's business newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun said in an article that the advertising industry predicts the cost of political advertising in this year's U.S. presidential election has surged, of which 70 percent are \"negative advertisements\" used to attack political opponents, and that expensive \"slander campaigns\" will intensify.\nMoney runs deep on all levels of the American political system.\nThe rampant gun violence is inseparable from the fact that gun interest groups invest heavily in supporting politicians who are in favor of protecting the right to own guns and blocking the passage of gun control bills.\nBehind the epidemic of drugs, there are also a lot of lobbying and political donations from large pharmaceutical companies.\nWhile campaign spending is seeing an incredible rise, investment in the country's dilapidated infrastructure is quite small. The recent bridge collapse tragedy in Baltimore, Maryland revealed the true state of dilapidated infrastructure across the United States.\nThe many social and economic problems in the United States today are the result of power serving money, and politicians turning a deaf ear to public opinion and being indifferent to people's livelihood.\nFor a long time, military-industrial enterprises have funded members of Congress to achieve personal political goals, and lawmakers have approved huge military expenditures to reciprocate and take advantage of the opportunity to make profits.\nSenior U.S. defense officials have provided a steady stream of military contracts, arbitraged through the \"revolving door\" between politics and business.\nTo maintain the operation of this huge interest chain, this interest group formed by the military, military industrial enterprises and politicians has constantly provoked conflicts and created wars around the world, plunging many countries and regions into wars and turmoil.\nAs Boaventura de Sousa Santosone, a Portuguese expert on international issues, once pointed out, U.S. foreign policy and democracy are dominated by three oligarchies: the military-industrial complex; the gas, oil and mining complex; and the banking and real estate complex. One of their ways to gain exorbitant profits is to keep the world at war, and they are increasingly dependent on US arms sales.\nIn today's American political reality, the U.S. dollar controls the power and money truly dominates election campaigns.\nUnder the influence of money, American politics shows the disconnection between elite politics and public opinion, policy-making and social reality.  ■"

    "content": "International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach hailed Xinhua as a global media leader for Olympic news during his video message to congratulate Xinhua Sports on its 40th anniversary.\nBEIJING, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach congratulated Xinhua Sports News Department on its 40th anniversary via video, saying that Xinhua has become a global media leader in Olympic news.\n\"As you celebrate your 40th anniversary, I would like to congratulate everyone at Xinhua Sports on this important milestone. You have every reason to look back with great pride over the past 40 years,\" said Bach.\n\"During this time, Xinhua Sports has evolved from humble beginnings in 1980, to an international news agency with a truly global reach today.\n\"Since your foundation, you have also established yourself as a global media leader for news about the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement.\"\nIn 2008, during the Beijing Olympics, Xinhua was authorized by the IOC to become the host news agency and the NOPP. And on January 30, 2019, Bach visited Xinhua headquarters and announced that Xinhua has become an International News Agency recognized by the IOC.\n\"All this is a testament to your strong standing in the international media landscape,\" Bach commented.\n\"Xinhua's reporting goes well beyond the latest results and scores on the field of play. You regularly highlight the many stories off the field of play as well, whether explaining the complexities of organizing Olympic Games, analyzing post-Games legacies, or putting the spotlight on the important social role of sport to improve our everyday lives.\n\"With your comprehensive reporting on so many aspects of sport, we are also deepening the understanding of the overarching mission of the IOC: to make the world a better place through sport,\" the IOC chief stated.\nThe 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place in Paris, and Bach noted that the anniversary of Xinhua Sports was at a very auspicious time at the start of the Olympic year.\n\"Xinhua's own preparations for Paris are already in full swing, and it is great to see you are fully living up to your leadership role by dedicating a team of over 200 journalists to cover this Olympic Games of a new era. Just like the athletes, all of you, the dedicated team of Xinhua Sports continue to demonstrate our new Olympic motto: Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together.\"\nBach said it might not be a coincidence that the birthdays of both Xinhua Sports and Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, are on January 1.\n\"Over 100 years ago, our founder Pierre De Coubertin contributed countless articles to dozens of publications, laying the groundwork for the great tradition of Olympic journalism. Knowing that Pierre De Coubertin shares not only the same birthday, but also the same passion for Olympic journalism as you, Xinhua Sports,\" he added.\nAt the end of the video, Bach wished Xinhua Sports all the best for the next 40 years and beyond, adding in Chinese, \"Congratulations to Xinhua Sports!\"\nIn 1979, China resumed its legitimate seat at the International Olympic Committee. The following year, Xinhua News Agency dispatched reporters to cover the Lake Placid Winter Olympics.\nTo better coordinate international and domestic sports reporting and enhance its influence in sports reporting, Xinhua established the Sports News Department on January 1, 1984. In the same year, a team of 30 reporters was sent to cover the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Since then, Xinhua has sent reporting teams to cover every Olympic Summer and Winter Games.\nXinhua will send a team of over 200 reporters and photographers to cover the Paris 2024 Olympics.  ■"

    "content": "BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Accelerating global economic recovery necessitates stimulating business vitality in the world economy, driven by an entrepreneurial spirit that fuels innovation and advances social progress.\nThemed \"Entrepreneurship: The Driving Force of the Global Economy,\" the 14th Annual Meeting of the New Champions, also known as Summer Davos Forum, opened on Tuesday in China's Tianjin Municipality.\nEntrepreneurial spirit is the primary driver of innovative thinking and technological advancement.\nThe world faces challenges such as slowing growth, climate change and wealth gap. Rising unilateralism, protectionism and de-globalization harm the environment for international businesses and partnerships. Instability, uncertainty and unpredictability are on the rise.\nAt this critical juncture, it is important to give full play to the entrepreneurial spirit, which is embodied by a willingness to take risks, the ability to identify opportunities, a commitment to continuous learning, and fearlessness in the face of difficulties and setbacks.\nCurrently, the latest technological revolutions and industrial transformations are gaining momentum. The world needs the power of innovation more than ever, particularly in fields like artificial intelligence, big data, blockchain and new energy. It is imperative that we increase investment and accelerate the digitalization process to create new drivers of economic growth and infuse sustained momentum into the global economy.\nIn the first quarter of this year, China's GDP grew by 4.5 percent year on year, and it is expected to expand even faster in the second quarter. The country is on track to achieve the growth target of around 5 percent as set by the government.\nChina is committed to collaborating with entrepreneurs from different countries in support of economic globalization, upholding the market economy, and firmly endorsing free trade. A total of 11,000 new foreign-invested companies were established in China in the first quarter, representing a 7.6 percent year-on-year increase.\nIn his speech at the Summer Davos opening plenary, Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, called for global efforts to fight fragmentation and strive for dialogue, understanding and collaboration.\nValuing entrepreneurship and win-win cooperation, the world should work together to keep global industrial and supply chains stable and smooth, and deliver the fruits of globalization to different countries and groups of people in a more equitable way by steering the global economy towards a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable future.  ■"

    "content": "新华社北京9月24日电  题：惠及5000万户家庭，存量房贷利率下调！\n新华社记者 吴雨\n存量房贷利率下调！将惠及5000万户有存量房贷的家庭。\n\n9月24日，中国人民银行行长潘功胜在国新办新闻发布会上表示，降低存量房贷利率，并统一房贷最低首付比例，引导商业银行将存量房贷利率降至新发放房贷利率附近。\n当日，潘功胜在发布会上介绍，中国人民银行拟指导银行对存量房贷利率进行批量调整，预计平均降幅在0.5个百分点左右。预计该政策将惠及5000万户家庭、1.5亿人口，平均每年减少家庭利息支出总数为1500亿元左右。\n对于降低存量房贷利率，不少借款人并不陌生。去年8月，中国人民银行推动商业银行有序降低存量房贷利率，调整后存量首套房贷利率平均降幅0.73个百分点。\n不过，随着我国利率水平持续走低，新增与存量房贷利差持续扩大，引起普遍关注。\n今年以来，中国人民银行已两次调整5年期以上贷款市场报价利率（LPR），累计下降35个基点。数据显示，8月份，新发放个人住房贷款利率为3.35%，比上年同期低78个基点，处于历史低位。多个城市新发放的首套住房贷款利率降至3.2%附近，部分地区甚至降至“2字头”。\n与此同时，去年存量首套房贷利率调降后，目前存量房贷利率仍普遍在4%左右。尤其是在北京、上海、深圳、广州等城市，原来加点幅度比较高，新发放按揭贷款和原来存量按揭贷款之间的利差更大。\n眼看新增房贷的利率越来越低，不少存量房贷借款人心理落差加大，更有人加入了“提前还贷”的行列中。\n这也在中金公司的研究测算中得以印证：目前银行按揭早偿率仍位于14%左右的高位，并且可能存在使用消费贷和经营贷置换按揭的空间。\n潘功胜在发布会上明确表示，进一步降低借款人房贷利息支出有助于促进扩大消费和投资，也有利于减少提前还贷行为，同时还可以压缩违规置换存量房贷的空间，保护金融消费者的合法权益，维护房地产市场平稳健康发展。\n除了降低存量房贷利率，中国人民银行和金融监管总局还明确：全国层面商业性个人住房贷款将不再区分首套、二套住房，最低首付比例统一至15%。\n此前，在5月推出的房贷新政中，首套和二套房贷最低首付款比例分别降至不低于15%和不低于25%。随着此次最低首付比例统一至15%，二套房首付款比例也创下近年新低。\n招联首席研究员董希淼说，此次住房金融政策调整力度较大，超出预期，传递出稳定房地产市场的明确信号，有助于稳定住房消费信心，提高居民住房消费的意愿和能力。\n不过，潘功胜也强调，各地可因城施策，自主确定是否采取差别化的安排，并确定辖区最低首付比例下限。同时，商业银行根据客户风险状况和意愿，与客户协商确定具体的首付比例水平。\n\n房贷利好政策何时落地？\n记者从发布会上了解到，因为涉及借款人众多，银行也需要有一定的时间进行必要的技术准备，比如进行修订合同文本、改造调整系统等。\n值得关注的是，潘功胜明确提出，“将指导商业银行完善按揭贷款的定价机制”。记者从中国人民银行了解到，这意味着银行批量调整存量房贷利率可能是最后一次。随着银行不断完善按揭贷款的定价机制，今后存量房贷利率将由银行、客户双方基于市场化原则自主协商，进行动态调整。\n近年来，中国人民银行不断完善房地产金融宏观审慎政策，从供需两端综合施策，多次调降个人住房贷款的最低首付比例、降低贷款利率、取消利率政策下限，设立保障性住房再贷款支持收购存量商品房等系列政策。\n此次，在支持居民购房需求端同时，金融管理部门还推出不少利好房企的政策举措。\n例如，房企存量融资展期、经营性物业贷款等阶段性政策延长到2026年底；又如，保障性住房再贷款政策中中国人民银行的出资比例提高到100%；再如，研究允许政策性银行、商业银行贷款支持有条件的企业市场化收购房企土地……\n近期，一系列新的房地产金融举措将陆续落地，既是回应当下市场期待，也从金融角度，更好支持房地产市场的风险化解和平稳健康发展，将为经济稳增长和高质量发展创造良好的金融环境。"

    "content": "新华社北京9月24日电 题：稳预期稳信心 多项金融政策齐发力支持经济高质量发展\n新华社记者李延霞、吴雨、刘慧\n降低存款准备金率和政策利率、降低存量房贷利率、推动中长期资金入市……在国新办24日举行的新闻发布会上，中国人民银行、金融监管总局、证监会三部门公布多项重磅金融政策，释放金融支持经济高质量发展的强烈信号。\n多项政策支持经济稳增长\n发布会上，中国人民银行行长潘功胜宣布，近期将下调存款准备金率0.5个百分点，向金融市场提供长期流动性约1万亿元；降低中央银行的政策利率，即7天期逆回购操作利率下调0.2个百分点，从目前的1.7%调降至1.5%。\n潘功胜表示，今年年内还将视市场流动性的状况，可能择机进一步下调存款准备金率0.25至0.5个百分点。“人民银行将坚定坚持支持性的货币政策立场，加大货币政策调控的强度，提高货币政策调控的精准性，为经济稳定增长和高质量发展创造良好的货币金融环境。”\n大型商业银行是我国金融体系中服务实体经济的主力军、维护金融稳定的压舱石。金融监管总局局长李云泽表示，经研究，国家计划对六家大型商业银行增加核心一级资本，将按照“统筹推进、分期分批、一行一策”的思路，有序实施。\n如何加大对重点领域和薄弱环节的支持力度？李云泽表示，前期，大型商业银行下设的金融资产投资公司已在上海开展股权投资试点，金融监管总局将会同有关部门研究将试点范围扩大至北京等18个科技创新活跃的大中型城市，同时适当放宽股权投资金额和比例限制。\n针对中小微企业融资难题，李云泽表示，金融监管总局将会同国家发展改革委建立支持小微企业融资协调工作机制，在区县层面建立工作专班。同时进一步优化无还本续贷政策，将续贷对象由原来的部分小微企业扩展至所有小微企业，并将续贷政策阶段性扩大到中型企业，期限暂定为三年，2027年9月30日前到期的中型企业流动资金贷款，都可以参照小微企业的续贷政策。\n证监会主席吴清表示，证监会将积极支持上市公司围绕战略性新兴产业、未来产业等进行并购重组，包括开展基于转型升级等目标的跨行业并购，以及有助于补链强链、提升关键核心技术水平的未盈利资产收购，引导更多的资源要素向新质生产力方向集聚。\n促进房地产市场平稳健康发展\n房地产市场的平稳健康发展事关经济金融大局和人民群众的切身利益。\n引导银行降低存量房贷利率、统一房贷最低首付比例至15%、延长两项房地产金融政策文件的期限、优化保障性住房再贷款政策、支持收购房企存量土地……发布会上，金融管理部门宣布多项房地产金融支持政策。\n“银行下调存量房贷利率，有利于进一步降低借款人房贷利息支出，预计这一项政策将惠及5000万户家庭，1.5亿人口，平均每年减少家庭的利息支出总数1500亿元左右。”潘功胜表示。\n此前，人民银行宣布设立3000亿元保障性住房再贷款。“为进一步增强对银行和收购主体的市场化激励，我们将保障性住房再贷款政策中人民银行出资的比例，由原来的60%提高到100%，加快推动商品房的去库存进程。”潘功胜说。\n支持收购房企存量土地方面，潘功胜表示，在将部分地方政府专项债券用于土地储备的基础上，研究允许政策性银行、商业银行贷款支持有条件的企业市场化收购房企土地，盘活存量用地，缓解房企资金压力。\n自今年1月城市房地产融资协调机制建立以来，截至目前，商业银行已审批“白名单”项目超过5700个，审批通过融资金额达到1.43万亿元，支持400余万套住房如期交付。\n“我们将进一步推动城市房地产融资协调机制落地见效，切实做到‘应进尽进’‘应贷尽贷’‘应放尽放’，坚决打赢保交房攻坚战，促进房地产市场平稳健康发展。”李云泽说。\n支持资本市场稳健发展\n发布会上，金融管理部门宣布多项支持资本市场稳健发展的举措。\n“人民银行与证监会、金融监管总局协商，创设两项结构性货币政策工具，支持资本市场稳定发展。这也是人民银行第一次创新结构性货币政策工具支持资本市场。”潘功胜表示。\n两项结构性货币政策工具一项是创设证券、基金、保险公司互换便利，支持符合条件的证券、基金、保险公司通过资产质押，从中央银行获取流动性。另一项是创设股票回购、增持专项再贷款，引导银行向上市公司和主要股东提供贷款，支持回购和增持股票。\n吴清表示，为进一步打通中长期资金入市的痛点堵点，证监会等相关部门制定了《关于推动中长期资金入市的指导意见》，近日将会印发，重点举措包括大力发展权益类公募基金、完善“长钱长投”的制度环境、持续改善资本市场生态等。\n“我们最近将就市值管理指引公开征求意见。同时，会同相关部委推动建立上市公司股份回购的市场化激励约束机制，激发上市公司大股东、高管等相关主体的内生动力，进一步提升上市公司投资价值。”吴清表示。\n保险资金规模大、期限长、来源稳定，天然具有耐心资本的属性。李云泽表示，下一步将扩大保险资金长期投资改革试点；督促指导保险公司优化考核机制，鼓励引导保险资金开展长期权益投资；鼓励理财公司、信托公司加强权益投资能力建设，发行更多长期限权益产品，支持资本市场持续稳健发展。"

    "content": "BEIJING, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are the top 10 world news events in the year 2023 selected by Xinhua in a chronological order:\n1. Generative AI accelerates industrial transformation\nThe number of monthly active users of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, reached 100 million in January. Generative AI represented by ChatGPT is developing rapidly, and this revolutionary tool excels in solving tasks such as content creation.\nTech giants from multiple countries are competing to pour investment into AI research and development and accelerate the integration of their products with AI applications. As an important driving force for a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation, AI brings huge opportunities and is expected to accelerate the reshaping of multiple industries. At the same time, it is accompanied by unpredictable risks and challenges.\nChina has put forward the Global AI Governance Initiative to provide Chinese solutions for the global AI governance.\n2. Devastating earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria cause heavy casualties\nA 7.7-magnitude earthquake on Feb. 6 struck the southern region of Türkiye near the Syrian border, followed by continuous aftershocks.\nThe disaster caused more than 50,000 deaths in Türkiye and more than 1,000 deaths in Syria. Morocco, Afghanistan, Nepal and other countries have also been hit by powerful earthquakes this year, which caused severe losses of life and property damage.\nChina immediately dispatched a rescue team to Türkiye after the earthquake, trying its best to save lives, and provided emergency humanitarian assistance to disaster-stricken countries multiple times, which is a testament to the notion of building a community with a shared future for mankind.\n3. Saudi-Iran deal brokered by China spurs reconciliation wave in the Middle East\nWith China's mediation, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached a groundbreaking agreement in Beijing on March 10 to resume diplomatic relations that had been severed for seven years. In April, the two countries formally resumed diplomatic ties.\nThe two countries shook hands and made peace, catalysing reconciliation among many countries in the Middle East. In the following months, Syria has rejoined the Arab League, and Egypt and Türkiye have restored ambassador-level diplomatic relations. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, and other countries have taken steps towards normalizing their relations with Qatar.\nThe momentum of easing tensions and seeking development and cooperation among regional countries indicates that resolving conflicts and differences through dialogue and consultation aligns with the aspirations of the people, conforms to the trend of the times, and serves the interests of all nations.\n4. \"De-risking\" exacerbates global economic predicament\nIn March, some Western politicians came up with the concept of \"de-risking,\" extending the underlying logic of \"decoupling\" and the \"small yard, high fence\" doctrine. This goes against economic laws and historical development trends, essentially rejecting opportunities, cooperation, stability and development.\nCurrently, the world economy faces multiple challenges which thwart the recovery process. The Federal Reserve's continued aggressive interest rate hikes have sharply increased risks in American and European banking sectors, leading to deteriorating global liquidity and rising default risks in emerging economies.\nThe United States has been persistently advancing protectionist industrial policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, causing other developed countries to follow suit, destabilizing international production and supply chains. The politicization and weaponization of economic and trade issues by the United States and some other Western countries are disrupting global markets and exacerbating the world's economic plight.\n5. The Global South's resounding support for multilateralism\nOn Aug. 24, the BRICS cooperation mechanism witnessed a historic expansion as countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Iran and Ethiopia were invited to join the BRICS family.\nOn Sept. 9, the African Union was invited to officially become a member of the G20.\nCurrently, the strength of developing countries is continuously growing, and the collective rise of the Global South has become an irreversible trend. The call and desire for unity, coordination and collaborative development have never been stronger.\nAs the largest developing country, China is a natural member of the Global South, firmly safeguarding the common interests of developing countries and promoting increased representation and voice of emerging market economies and developing countries in global affairs.\n6. Japan discharges nuclear-contaminated water amid opposition\nOn Aug. 24, Japan started discharging contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear incident, despite widespread international questioning and strong objections from concerned nations.\nJapan released more than 23,000 tons of nuclear-contaminated water in three rounds of discharge in the year. The entire discharge will take at least 30 years to finish. This unprecedented release of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean and the potential cumulative marine effects have triggered widespread concern worldwide.\nThe discharge, which is by no means a private matter for Japan, involves the health of all humanity, the global marine environment and global public interests. Japan should seriously address the legitimate concerns both at home and abroad, and handle the Fukushima nuclear wastewater issue responsibly and constructively.\n7. Israeli-Palestinian conflict highlights intensifying turbulence globally\nOn Oct. 7, a new round of conflict erupted between Israel and Palestine.\nOver the past two months, the conflict has resulted in the deaths of more than 20,000 Palestinians, leading to a severe humanitarian crisis. More than 1,000 Israelis have also lost their lives.\nThe international call for the protection of civilians and a cessation of hostilities keeps growing. The fundamental solution to the frequent recurrence of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies in implementing the two-state solution, restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and establishing an independent Palestinian state.\nSince the beginning of this year, the Ukraine crisis has dragged on, armed conflicts have broken out in Sudan, and coups have taken place in Niger and Gabon. Local conflicts and regional hot spots keep flaring up, and the international situation is becoming more volatile.\n8.

The power of capital permeates and affects all aspects of American society through political power, forming an \"American democracy\" that is very much dependent on money.\nIn recent years, the cost of elections in the United States has skyrocketed, and money and politics have become more closely intertwined.\nThe total spending of the 2020 U.S. election was as high as 14 billion dollars, twice that of 2016, with 6.6 billion dollars spent on the presidential election and more than 7 billion dollars on the Congressional elections, according to statistics from the Center for Responsive Politics.\nSome American research institutions predict that 2024 will be the most expensive election cycle in American history, with candidates spending more than 10 billion dollars on political advertising alone.\nThe financial threshold for participating in elections is getting increasingly higher.\nAlthough people have the right to vote, they cannot exert a real influence over politics, which makes the \"free election\" that American democracy claims an empty slogan.\n\"The Irony of Democracy: An Uncommon Introduction to American Politics,\" co-authored by Louis Schubert, Thomas R. Dye and Harmon Zeigler, argues that the American people no longer believe that the government serves the common good, and most people think that a few large interest groups control the American political system, and often neglect the public interest to serve their own interests.\nThe intensification of partisan rivalry is an important factor driving rising election costs.\nIn recent years, American society has become increasingly polarized and so has public opinion. The two major political parties and their supporters compete for votes in an extremely fierce manner.\nTo \"buy\" the political power that will dominate resource allocation in the future, additional bets have been continuously added, thus pushing up campaign costs.\nPoliticians are particularly good at turning social tensions, which involve issues of climate change, abortion, trade, immigration and other aspects of the economy and people's livelihood, into tools to win over public opinion.\nWith more and more issues involved in party rivalry, the two parties are under increased pressure to invest more money in policy-making and advertising to win public opinion.\nIn addition, in the context of intensified party rivalry, the cost of candidates attacking and slandering each other and the two parties fighting each other is also high.\nJapan's business newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun said in an article that the advertising industry predicts the cost of political advertising in this year's U.S. presidential election has surged, of which 70 percent are \"negative advertisements\" used to attack political opponents, and that expensive \"slander campaigns\" will intensify.\nMoney runs deep on all levels of the American political system.\nThe rampant gun violence is inseparable from the fact that gun interest groups invest heavily in supporting politicians who are in favor of protecting the right to own guns and blocking the passage of gun control bills.\nBehind the epidemic of drugs, there are also a lot of lobbying and political donations from large pharmaceutical companies.\nWhile campaign spending is seeing an incredible rise, investment in the country's dilapidated infrastructure is quite small. The recent bridge collapse tragedy in Baltimore, Maryland revealed the true state of dilapidated infrastructure across the United States.\nThe many social and economic problems in the United States today are the result of power serving money, and politicians turning a deaf ear to public opinion and being indifferent to people's livelihood.\nFor a long time, military-industrial enterprises have funded members of Congress to achieve personal political goals, and lawmakers have approved huge military expenditures to reciprocate and take advantage of the opportunity to make profits.\nSenior U.S. defense officials have provided a steady stream of military contracts, arbitraged through the \"revolving door\" between politics and business.\nTo maintain the operation of this huge interest chain, this interest group formed by the military, military industrial enterprises and politicians has constantly provoked conflicts and created wars around the world, plunging many countries and regions into wars and turmoil.\nAs Boaventura de Sousa Santosone, a Portuguese expert on international issues, once pointed out, U.S. foreign policy and democracy are dominated by three oligarchies: the military-industrial complex; the gas, oil and mining complex; and the banking and real estate complex. One of their ways to gain exorbitant profits is to keep the world at war, and they are increasingly dependent on US arms sales.\nIn today's American political reality, the U.S. dollar controls the power and money truly dominates election campaigns.\nUnder the influence of money, American politics shows the disconnection between elite politics and public opinion, policy-making and social reality.  ■"

Luxor, the ancient city of Thebes in southern Egypt, was the pharaohs' capital at the height of their power during the New Kingdom from the 16th century BC to the 11th century BC. Seen by many as the world's largest open-air museum, it is home to famous Tutankhamen's tomb in the Valley of the Kings and the ruins of the huge Karnak Temple Complex and Luxor Temple.\nThe Yin Ruins, which is located in Anyang of central China's Henan Province, is the first documented late Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 B.C.) capital site in China, as confirmed by archaeological excavations and oracle bone inscriptions.\nLuxor and the Yin Ruins have, respectively, witnessed the historic highlights of the development of Egypt and China, the two ancient civilizations.\nApril 18 marks the International Day for Monuments and Sites.

Located on the central region of the Dongting Lake, Datong Lake is known as \"the heart of the Dongting\". Due to disorder aquaculture development, the water quality of Datong Lake was once seriously deteriorated.\nIn January 2018, an aquatic vegetation planting project was launched in Datong Lake area, with a team from Wuhan University providing technical guidance. In order to support the comprehensive water environment management and ecological industry development of Datong Lake, a scientific workstation was established here in April 2019.\nLi Yang, a postdoctoral fellow from Wuhan University, has been working at Datong Lake since 2018. While completing the project experiments, Li Yang and other stationed researchers also regularly monitor the water quality, vegetation and soil dynamics of the Datong Lake basin, laying a good scientific foundation for the next step of lake management.\nNowadays, the water quality of Datong Lake has seen significant improvement, and the coverage area of aquatic vegetation has stabilized at about 50,000 mu (about 3333.33 hectares). With the improvement of biodiversity, the ecosystem has developed steadily.\nDuring the six years of work in lake management, Li Yang completed his doctoral project in Datong Lake and continued his postdoctoral research here. Over the years, he has been deeply involved in the local ecological governance and green development, witnessing an impressive transformation of Datong Lake.

Seen by many as the world's largest open-air museum, it is home to famous Tutankhamen's tomb in the Valley of the Kings and the ruins of the huge Karnak Temple Complex and Luxor Temple.\nThe Yin Ruins, which is located in Anyang of central China's Henan Province, is the first documented late Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 B.C.) capital site in China, as confirmed by archaeological excavations and oracle bone inscriptions.\nLuxor and the Yin Ruins have, respectively, witnessed the historic highlights of the development of Egypt and China, the two ancient civilizations.\nApril 18 marks the International Day for Monuments and Sites. It is a sound occasion to explore the trace of past glory and have a touch with the glamour of ancient civilizations through the pictures of the two historic sites. (Xinhua/Li An)"

    "content": "BEIJING, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach congratulated Xinhua Sports News Department on its 40th anniversary via video, saying that Xinhua has become a global media leader in Olympic news.\n\"As you celebrate your 40th anniversary, I would like to congratulate everyone at Xinhua Sports on this important milestone. You have every reason to look back with great pride over the past 40 years,\" said Bach.\n\"During this time, Xinhua Sports has evolved from humble beginnings in 1980, to an international news agency with a truly global reach today.\n\"Since your foundation, you have also established yourself as a global media leader for news about the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement.\"\nIn 2008, during the Beijing Olympics, Xinhua was authorized by the IOC to become the host news agency and the NOPP. And on January 30, 2019, Bach visited Xinhua and announced that Xinhua has become an International News Agency recognized by the IOC.\n\"All this is a testament to your strong standing in the international media landscape,\" Bach commented.\n\"Xinhua's reporting goes well beyond the latest results and scores on the field of play. You regularly highlight the many stories off the field of play as well, whether explaining the complexities of organizing Olympic Games, analyzing post-Games legacies, or putting the spotlight on the important social role of sport to improve our everyday lives.\n\"With your comprehensive reporting on so many aspects of sport, we are also deepening the understanding of the overarching mission of the IOC: to make the world a better place through sport,\" the IOC chief stated.\nThe 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place in Paris, and Bach noted that the anniversary of Xinhua Sports was at a very auspicious time at the start of the Olympic year.\n\"Xinhua's own preparations for Paris are already in full swing, and it is great to see you are fully living up to your leadership role by dedicating a team of over 200 journalists to cover this Olympic Games of a new era. Just like the athletes, all of you, the dedicated team of Xinhua Sports continue to demonstrate our new Olympic motto: Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together.\"\nBach said it might not be a coincidence that the birthdays of both Xinhua Sports and Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, are on January 1.\n\"Over 100 years ago, our founder Pierre De Coubertin contributed countless articles to dozens of publications, laying the groundwork for the great tradition of Olympic journalism. Knowing that Pierre De Coubertin shares not only the same birthday, but also the same passion for Olympic journalism as you, Xinhua Sports,\" he added.\nAt the end of the video, Bach wished Xinhua Sports all the best for the next 40 years and beyond, adding in Chinese, \"Congratulations to Xinhua Sports!\"\nIn 1979, China resumed its legitimate seat at the International Olympic Committee. The following year, Xinhua News Agency dispatched reporters to cover the Lake Placid Winter Olympics.\nTo better coordinate international and domestic sports reporting and enhance its influence in sports reporting, Xinhua established the Sports News Department on January 1, 1984. In the same year, a team of 30 reporters was sent to cover the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Since then, Xinhua has sent reporting teams to cover every Olympic Summer and Winter Games.\nXinhua will send a team of over 200 reporters and photographers to cover the Paris 2024 Olympics.  ■"

As we have always maintained, 'Each teenage pregnancy is still one too many,'\" Bersales added.\nThe government survey said the spacing between children's births widened from 36.8 months in 2018 to 46.5 months in 2022. Bersales said the data \"greatly promotes better health and well-being for Filipino mothers and their young children.\"\nIn January, the PSA said teenage pregnancy among Filipinos aged 15 to 19 in the Philippines declined from 8.6 percent in 2017 to 5.4 percent in 2022.\nIn 2022, the data showed that 19-year-olds had the highest pregnancy percentage recorded at 13.3 percent, followed by those aged 18 at 5.9 percent and 17 at 5.6 percent. The lowest teenage pregnancy rate was among those aged 16 and 15.\nThe data showed that teenage pregnancy was lower in urban areas at 4.8 percent than in rural areas at 6.1 percent. ■"

It combined lighting, costumes, music, and dance to create a stunning fusion of the past and present.\nAs the composer and pipa soloist of the performance, Yu Bing from the Shanghai Chinese Orchestra contemplated composing a new musical piece inspired by the depiction of musical instruments and musicians found in the Yungang Grottoes since 2022.\nAfter more than a year of repeated exploration and experimentation, the artists attempted to present traditional folk percussion music in a contemporary manner that embodies the rich philosophical thoughts of Chinese culture and highlights the artistic connotations of the Yungang Grottoes.\nIn the costume part, designer Yang Fengrui selected the honeysuckle pattern from the Yungang Grottoes as the fundamental design motif, as well as a color reminiscent of the iconic \"Yungang red\" to infuse the costumes with a visual representation of the artistic legacy and historical significance.\nYungang Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage site featuring over 50,000 stone Buddhist sculptures in Datong, was built during the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534). It is considered a pinnacle of Chinese Buddhist art and represents the highest level of sculptural artistry in the world during the 5th century.  ■"

    "content": "The \"overcapacity\" charges reveal Washington's double standard on practicing the principles advocating market economy, free trade and the global division of labor, which the United States has claimed to embrace for centuries.\nBEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- A top priority of U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen during her just-concluded second China trip was to raise Washington's concerns to Beijing over the so-called \"overcapacity\" in China's flourishing green industries.\nPrior to her visit, \"Chinese overproduction\" accusations coming out of Washington have flooded mainstream Western media, claiming that China could overwhelm world markets with cheap exports of solar panels and electric vehicles (EVs).\nWashington's concerns are as unfounded as they are misleading. They are also a reflection of the zero-sum mindset of some policymakers in Washington.\nIn recent years, Washington has grown increasingly agitated over China's high-tech advancement, fearing the possible loss of its global technological supremacy. It has adopted a \"small yard, high fence\" strategy, slapped semiconductor sanctions against China, and blacklisted a number of Chinese tech firms under the pretext of national security.\nThe \"overcapacity\" charges also reveal Washington's double standard on practicing the principles advocating market economy, free trade and the global division of labor, which the United States has claimed to embrace for centuries: Whenever U.S. industries are in an advantageous position, Washington champions the omnipotence of the market and free global trade; but when American companies face serious competition, the United States looks the other way, and puts up a protectionist shield.\nDavid Fickling, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, said in a recent opinion piece that \"Yellen junks 200 years of economics to block China clean tech\" and that the attempt is a protectionist disaster that will impede the path to net zero.\nInstead of criticizing the fast development of green industries in China, the United States should shift its focus to strengthening its own. Bloomberg has noted that the crux of the issue for advanced economies, including the United States, lies in the efficiency and competitiveness of Chinese electric carmakers, including their technological prowess and modern transport infrastructure.\nIn fact, contrary to an \"overcapacity problem,\" the clean energy sector is struggling to meet global demand amidst urgent climate change concerns and widespread efforts towards energy transition.\nAt the end of 2023, the International Renewable Energy Agency projected that in order to keep the Paris targets alive, global renewable power capacity must grow by around 1,000 GW a year through 2030.\nIn 2023, a year with a record high capacity addition, the world had an increase of around 507 GW, half of what was needed to keep the 1.5-degree target within reach, according to the International Energy Agency's Renewables 2023 report.\nOne of the most prominent obstacles to the global energy transition, the report said, is insufficient financing in developing countries, where capital can be two to three times higher than in mature renewable energy markets. Behind the investment gap lies the Western-dominated financial order, which puts monetary gains over developmental rights.\nInstead of fanning Sinophobia to slow China's growth, Washington would be better served by sharpening its own technological strength and clean energy infrastructure. This also needs a commitment to defending free market ideals, which the United States claims to support.\nChina and the United States have more, not fewer, common interests. It is China's stance that the two sides should help rather than hinder each other's development, both in traditional areas such as trade and agriculture, and in emerging areas such as climate change and artificial intelligence.\nBefore departing for Washington following her China visit, Yellen repeated Washington's pledge not to seek decoupling from China. Simply rejecting \"decoupling\" verbally is not enough to create a healthy economic relationship between the world's top two economies. Only win-win cooperation in deeds can.■"

It was crucial for the WMO and global weather forecasting that meteorological data from China's 9.6 million square km of territory be shared globally.\"\nOver the past 20 years, China has quickly taken a leading role within the WMO, thanks to its advancement in science and technology and meteorological development concepts.\nAccording to Zhang, the WMO needs data from about 1,000 vertical atmospheric observation balloons daily, with China contributing about 100, or 10 percent. Meanwhile, the WMO satellite program coordinates about 30 operational satellites, with seven or eight from China. These basic observation systems are the most powerful tools for monitoring meteorological hazards.\nAnother bright spot of Chinese technology has been in meteorological satellites. In 2017, the WMO and seven countries in Asia and Oceania, including China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia, Russia and India, agreed on an Asia and Oceania meteorological satellite user-sharing mechanism, which facilitates providing critical meteorological satellite services to more countries in the Southern Hemisphere that do not have their own meteorological satellites.\n\"In the event of major catastrophic weather events or major international political incidents, such a mechanism can provide meteorological satellite service in an observation frequency of every minute instead of every half an hour to respond more accurately to weather conditions such as typhoons,\" Zhang said.\nThe WMO has been calling on countries with meteorological satellites to provide observation services tailored to other countries experiencing major meteorological events. China was the first to respond to the call and has now signed agreements with 28 countries to provide meteorological observation service when needed.\nBehind all this are the advanced technology and increasing quantity of Chinese meteorological satellites over the past two decades.\nZhang said China now has four geostationary orbiting meteorological satellites in operation, covering about half of the Earth's surface area. Its Fengyun-4B meteorological satellite can provide a high-resolution observation of 250 meters every minute.\nZhang said China's meteorological satellites have benefited the world, taking the G20 summit in Indonesia last year as an example. To ensure the flight safety of the participating heads of state, he said that China provided tailored meteorological satellite observation service at the request of Indonesia for the best weather forecast and observation results.\n\"It showed that China's meteorological technology not only has served its national economy but also the security in major international political events,\" Zhang said.\nOn World Meteorological Day last year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for establishing a UN weather and climate early warning system within the next five years to protect every person on Earth against increasingly frequent extreme weather and climate change events.\n\"China has been persistently assisting the least developed countries in meteorological service, helping to train personnel and establish early warning systems,\" said Zhang.\n\"Early warning is highly dependent on observational data. On average, the WMO collects data from about 10,000 ground-based stations per day, of which about 500 are contributed by China, accounting for about 5 percent of the global total,\" said Zhang.\nSince 2013, China has assisted seven African countries in building ground-based meteorological observation networks, disaster mitigation and prevention systems, and offshore satellite reception systems with the WMO's coordination.\n\"China's unremitting assistance in meteorological services, especially to the least developed countries, has been recognized and appreciated by the majority of developing countries,\" Zhang said, adding that the WMO hopes that all countries with meteorological satellites follow suit by providing timely cooperation to developing and least developed countries. ■"

    "content": "\n\nMANILA, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from severe tropical storm Nalgae, which unleashed floods and set off landslides in several parts of the Philippines, has climbed to 72, a spokesperson for a government disaster agency said on Saturday.\nNational Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council spokesperson Rafaelito Alejandro said the bulk of the fatalities were in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines, with 67 deaths. He added that at least 14 people have remained missing.\nMaguindanao is a province in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Its interior and local government minister Naguib Sinarimbo said nine towns in Maguindanao were severely flooded, and most parts of Cotabato City in the BARMM were underwater for the first time in years. The BARMM has \"raised our alert level to red\" since Friday.\nAccording to local media reports, a village in Datu Odin Sinsuat was buried in the landslide, resulting in at least 50 deaths.\nNalgae is the 16th cyclone to lash the Philippines this year. It slammed into Catanduanes, an island province in the Bicol region, before dawn Saturday.\nThe Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said Nalgae was blowing maximum winds of 95 km per hour, with gusts of up to 160 km per hour on Saturday.\nThe national weather bureau said Nalgae was moving west-northwestward at 30 km per hour and expected to intensify further as it moved inland. It is forecast to cross Metro Manila and its adjacent areas early Saturday afternoon through Sunday morning.\nThe bureau warned flooding and rain-induced landslides are expected, especially in areas highly susceptible to these hazards and in localities with significant antecedent rainfall.\nThe Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries globally, mainly due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire and Pacific typhoon belt. On average, the archipelagic country experiences 20 typhoons yearly, some of which are intense and destructive.\nIn April, the tropical storm Megi dumped rains in central and southern parts of the Philippines, inundating many areas and causing landslides, resulting in over 220 deaths.\n\nProduced by Xinhua Global Service"

    "content": "* China and Nauru signed a joint communique in Beijing on Wednesday on the resumption of diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level.\n* The latest development once again shows that adherence to the one-China principle is an irresistible historical trend.\n* The reestablishment of the diplomatic ties represents the shared aspiration of Nauru and the Pacific islands countries.\nBEIJING, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- China and Nauru signed a joint communique in Beijing Wednesday on the resumption of diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level.\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, held talks with Nauru's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Lionel Aingimea and signed the joint communique, effective as of this day.\nThis communique made Nauru the 183rd country which has diplomatic ties with China.\nAccording to the joint communique, the Government of the Republic of Nauru recognizes that there is but one China in the world, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.\nThe joint communique said that the Government of the Republic of Nauru shall sever \"diplomatic relations\" with Taiwan as of this day and undertakes that it shall no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan.\nThe two governments agree to exchange ambassadors as early as possible and to provide each other with all the necessary assistance for the establishment of embassies, said the joint communique.\nA NEW CHAPTER OPENED\n\"Today, the China-Nauru ties have opened a new chapter,\" said Wang during the talks.\nWang said that although China and Nauru are geographically separated by oceans, the friendship between the two peoples has a long history. As developing countries, both sides are faced with the common tasks of developing economy, improving people's livelihood and realizing modernization.\nAs members of the Global South, the two sides share the same will to safeguard their own sovereignty and independence, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and promote an equal and orderly multi-polar world and economic globalization that benefits all. This is the fundamental logic that has brought the two countries closer to each other and will certainly bring broad prospects for cooperation, he said.\nWang stressed that the resumption of diplomatic ties between China and Nauru once again shows to the world that adherence to the one-China principle is an irresistible historical trend.\nWang pointed out that there are still a very few countries that maintain so-called \"diplomatic relations\" with Taiwan for various reasons, which not only goes against the interests of their own countries and their people, but also violates the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and infringes on China's national sovereignty. Such practices should be corrected sooner or later.\nChina urges these countries to recognize the trend of the times, said Wang, adding that China is ready to open a new chapter in its relations with these countries on the basis of the one-China principle.\nAingimea said that the Nauru government announced that it would completely sever \"diplomatic relations\" with the Taiwan region and seek to restore diplomatic relations with China, which won unanimous approval from the Nauruan Parliament and all parliamentary members stood up to express support. This fully proves that the decision is correct, popular and in line with the fundamental interests of Nauru, he added.\nNauru will adhere to the one-China principle and give priority to it in its foreign policy, Aingimea said.\nChina has won the hearts of the people of Nauru with its words and deeds, he said, noting that the resumption of diplomatic ties will further promote the friendship between the two countries.\nNauru is willing to take this day as a new starting point to enhance mutual trust, carry out comprehensive cooperation and establish and develop a strong partnership with China, Aingimea added.\nTREND OF THE TIMES, ASPIRATION OF THE PEOPLE\nChina's practical cooperation with Pacific island countries has brought tangible benefits to them, and more and more Pacific island countries have realized that establishing diplomatic ties and developing cooperation with China is the trend of the times and the aspiration of the people, said Zhao Shaofeng, deputy director of the Pacific Island Countries Research Center at Liaocheng University.\nGuo Chunmei, deputy director of Southeast Asia and Oceania Department of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that with its rich tourism and fishery resources, Nauru has much room for cooperation with China, noting that both countries also have common interests on the issue of climate change.\nNauru's choice was based on its own national development interests, said Su Xiaohui, associate research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, noting that the resumption of diplomatic relations with China is a right decision Nauru has taken to enhance mutually beneficial and win-win cooperation with China and realize its own development.\nWang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a daily news briefing that China's relations with Pacific island countries have continued to deepen, and the reestablishment of diplomatic ties between China and Nauru represents the shared aspiration of Nauru and the Pacific islands countries, and serves the fundamental and long-term interests of China and Nauru.\nChina will uphold the \"four full respects\" policy and work with Nauru in various fields based on equality, mutual respect, mutually beneficial cooperation, openness and inclusiveness for the benefit of the two peoples and their future generations, Wang said.\nFriendship is cherishable whenever it happens, Wang said.  ■"

He is now 22 years old, despite doctors once predicting that he would never live beyond 20.\nHowever, his physical disability has not stopped him from chasing his dream of becoming a photographer.\n\"Photography reminds me of the time when I was confined to bed during childhood. Lying in bed, I found that the rays of light through the window were so beautiful,\" Lhapa Dondrup recalled, adding that photography is his way of holding onto the beautiful moments in life.\n\nLhapa Dondrup takes photos during a wheelchair basketball training session in Lhasa, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, Nov. 26, 2023. (Xinhua/Jiang Fan)\nSunday marks Human Rights Day.\nLhapa Dondrup was born into a farming family in the rural area of Lhasa, the regional capital. His mother died when he was young, so he was adopted by relatives.\nSuffering from frequent fractures, he was diagnosed with brittle bone disease at 5 years old. During second grade in primary school, he had an accident that almost killed him.\n\"I accidentally fell down, resulting in broken ribs, which pressed hard against my organs,\" Lhapa Dondrup recalled.\nConcerned about his safety, his adoptive parents asked him to drop out of school. Long periods at home left Lhapa Dondrup feeling depressed, considering himself a burden both to his family and to society.\nIn 2018, he was offered to study at the Lhasa care center for people with disabilities, a development that gave him renewed hope.\n\"My family didn't allow me to go because of their fears concerning my health condition. So I lied to them, promising to return following a brief visit. But I stayed and studied there for three years,\" he said with a smile.\nAt the center, Lhapa Dondrup not only learned Tibetan calligraphy and Mandarin writing but also chose to learn photography and video editing, both of which he enjoys.\nIn his words, photography is all about light, with a photo capturing the light at a particular moment.\nHe believes his photographs are unique. \"Because of my height, my point of view is lower than that of other people, so I hope to capture a peculiar type of light in life from my own angle,\" Lhapa Dondrup said.\nIn 2021, Lhapa Dondrup met Jole, a disabled entrepreneur who started a business for Tibetan calligraphy training and stationery sales. Of the 42 employees hired by his company, 27 have disabilities.\n\nLhapa Dondrup (1st, R) takes photos during a wheelchair basketball training session in Lhasa, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, Nov. 26, 2023. (Xinhua/Jiang Fan)\nInspired by Jole, Lhapa Dondrup asked to join the company.\nJole said Lhapa Dondrup is full of enthusiasm and ambition. \"Most importantly, he didn't give up on himself, so I hired him,\" said Jole.\nJole supports Lhapa Dondrup's photography dream, giving him company cameras and encouraging him to pursue his dream. Caring people have also donated photographic equipment and taught him about photography.\nLhapa Dondrup is responsible for taking promotional photos for the company, as well as online operations. He earns 2,500 yuan (about 351.5 U.S. dollars) as monthly basic pay, excluding bonus, and receives 600 yuan from the government as a subsidy for people with disabilities.\n\nThis aerial photo taken on Dec. 2, 2023 shows Lhapa Dondrup practicing the operation of a drone in Lhasa, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region. (Xinhua/Jiang Fan)\nLast year, Lhapa Dondrup bought new clothes and shoes for his adoptive parents with his own salary to celebrate the Tibetan New Year.\n\"My parents were so happy, and I felt proud and confident to be supporting myself with my own hands,\" he said.\nAccording to a white paper issued last month, a basic multi-tiered social security system has been established in Xizang. The surveyed urban unemployment rate has remained below the national average and the number of families with no one in work has been steadily reduced to zero, the paper said.\nFor Lhapa Dondrup, photography is more than just a way to make a living. In his spare time, he takes pictures of pet animals and people in Barkhor Street, a famous scenic and shopping area located at the heart of Lhasa. Driving a motor tricycle, he travels as far as possible.\n\nLhapa Dondrup is pictured in front of Potala Palace in Lhasa, southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region, Dec. 2, 2023. (Xinhua/Jiang Fan)\nNext year, he plans to go to Beijing to visit his sister studying there.\n\"I want to take my camera to Tian'anmen Square and get some photos there,\" he said.\n(Video reporters: Purbu Tsering, Huang Yaoman, Lodro Gyatso; video editors: Zhang Nan, Wei Yin, Yu Jiaming, Jia Xiaotong, Lin Lin.)■"

They said the extreme depth helps block most cosmic rays that mess with the observation.\nThe Deep Underground and Ultra-low Radiation Background Facility for Frontier Physics Experiments (DURF) is located beneath Jinping Mountain in Sichuan's Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture. The DURF, with a total room capacity of 330,000 cubic meters, is the second phase of China Jinping Underground Laboratory.

Xinhua looks forward to enhancing cooperation with the Secretariat of the UNCCD to promote experience and achievements in combating desertification worldwide, and to contribute to the advancement of global green development.\nThiaw said that China has proved through its own practices that environmental protection and economic development can mutually reinforce each other. China is expected to play an important role at the convention's upcoming Conference of the Parties, which will be held at the end of this year. It is hoped that China will help the world better understand the crucial significance of combating desertification for humanity through the stories that Xinhua publishes, he said. ■\n\nPresident of Xinhua News Agency Fu Hua meets with Ibrahim Thiaw, UN under-secretary-general and executive secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and they sign a memorandum of understanding in Beijing, capital of China, May 24, 2024.

    "content": "LHASA, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- A series of recently released data regarding southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region highlights the all-round progress of the plateau region, once again debunking some Western smears and lies.\nThe region's gross domestic product expanded 9.5 percent year on year to nearly 240 billion yuan (about 33.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 2023, according to the regional statistics bureau.\nThe growth rates of the region's major economic indicators, including per capita disposable income, fixed asset investment, and total retail sales of consumer goods, all ranked first in the country.\nHowever, certain Western organizations and individuals have ignored these developments, choosing to weaponize so-called \"human rights issues\" as a means to manipulate global politics.\nThe most recent evidence of this practice surfaced when the Human Rights Watch baselessly accused Xizang of \"immersing\" Tibetan children in Mandarin without allowing the use and learning of Tibetan language in schools. The group also alleged the \"forced imposition of 'ethnic mingling' measures in Tibetan education, such as concentrated schooling and 'mixed classes.'\"\nSuch accusations disregard the truth and smear China based on ideological bias, unfounded rumors and falsehoods.\nThe reality is that Xizang has a sparse population and some children in pastoral areas reside far away from schools, rendering daily commutes practically unfeasible for them. Boarding schools not only guarantee the quality of education but also provide children with nutritious meals and a comfortable living environment on campus.\nAt school, students are provided with quality Tibetan-Mandarin bilingual teaching and education in traditional Tibetan culture. Many extracurricular classes are crafted around Tibetan culture, including local musical instruments and dance, and Tibetan calligraphy.\nXizang is the first provincial-level region in China to provide 15 years of publicly funded education, from kindergarten to senior high school. The completion rate for compulsory education has reached 97.73 percent. This stands in stark contrast to the situation 70 years ago when access to education was limited to the nobility.\nThe constant improvement of people's livelihoods in Xizang over the past decades speaks volumes, proving that the current developmental trajectory is most fitting for the region. The region's robust progress unequivocally rebuts the naysayers and their lies.  ■"

    "content": "\n* Multiple organizations in China have recently unveiled their lists of 2023's most popular catchphrases, new lexicons, and online buzzwords, painting a vivid picture of a dynamic and transforming country.\n* These phrases have succinctly captured various facets of the year, marking changes in Chinese people's perceptions and everyday lives.\n* Over the past decade, the top online buzzwords have also evolved, increasingly reflecting people's self-confidence as well as their confidence in the Chinese nation and Chinese culture.\nBEIJING, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- Multiple organizations in China have recently unveiled their lists of 2023's most popular catchphrases, new lexicons, and online buzzwords, painting a vivid picture of a dynamic and transforming country.\nFrom emerging technological terms such as \"generative AI,\" to grassroots sports phenomena like \"village basketball association,\" these phrases have succinctly captured various facets of the year, marking changes in Chinese people's perceptions and everyday lives.\n\nThis aerial photo taken on March 26, 2023 shows players warming up for a village basketball game in Taipan Village, Taijiang County, southwest China's Guizhou Province. (Xinhua/Ou Dongqu)\n\"These simple yet catchy buzzwords are the keenest sensors of social development,\" said Wang Xiaoyan, an associate professor at Beijing Normal University, adding that over the past decade, the top online buzzwords have also evolved, increasingly reflecting people's self-confidence as well as their confidence in the Chinese nation and Chinese culture.\nOn a list announced by the National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center recently, the 2023 online buzzwords span across the fields of everyday life, technology, sports, fashion, tourism, and workplaces. This compilation, drawn from a vast corpus of over 8 billion characters, includes varied linguistic resources from video comments to online news.\nTECH TALK\nIn a year marked by technological leaps, some tech jargon has made its way to a wider audience. Compared to the buzzwords in previous years, this year's list features a richer technology vocabulary, experts noted.\nAmong the top 10 online buzzwords, \"digital and intelligent life,\" is high on the list, reflecting a wider adoption of digital and smart technologies in Chinese people's daily lives.\n\nPeople try VR devices during the 11th China (Wuhu) Popularized Science Products Exposition in Wuhu, east China's Anhui Province, Oct. 21, 2023. (Xinhua/Du Yu)\nThe top 10 new phrases in 2023, as published by the organization, include \"generative AI,\" and \"battle of large models,\" both related to mushrooming AI applications based on large language models such as ChatGPT, or China tech giant Baidu's ERNIE Bot.\n\"Mozi xuntian,\" or \"Mozi's sky survey,\" is also on the list. The phrase refers to the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) nicknamed after the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi, also known as Micius, who is said to be the first in history to have conducted optical experiments. The WFST started operation in September 2023.\n\"Compared to the top 10 new phrases of 2022, this year's high-tech vocabulary is richer in content and greater in number. This indicates that 2023 is a year of increased innovation and vigorous development for China,\" said Ouyang Rihui, deputy director of the China Internet Economy Research Institute at the Central University of Finance and Economics.\nPERSONAL PANACHE\nOne of this year's buzzwords, \"Xianyanbao,\" which refers to people who are simply goofing around and trying to get others' attention, represents a popular shift towards celebrating individuality. Once slightly negative, this trendy term now positively identifies those who stand out for their uniqueness, reflecting a societal embrace of diversity and personal expression.\nSuch emphasis on individual expression is also reflected in a popular phrase for describing boldness in fashion choices -- \"dopamine dressing.\" While dopamine is known as a chemical essential for health and joy, the phrase \"dopamine dressing\" suggests moving away from understated attire. This style emphasizes using vivid, intensely colored outfits and striking color mixes to produce an enjoyable visual impact.\n\nTourists pose for a selfie with a giant snowman in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Dec. 17, 2023. (Photo by Liu Yang/Xinhua)\nGAMES, TOURS, ASPIRATIONS\nAlso on the list of online buzzwords is \"Village BA,\" or \"Village Basketball Association,\" a rural basketball tournament that first debuted in a county in southwest China's Guizhou Province and later evolved to become a nationwide sensation in the summer of 2023.\n\"More people enjoy recreational sports, while 'exercises' and 'health' are frequent topics discussed in the public domain,\" said Yang Xiaochun, a physical education teacher at a middle school in Guizhou, adding that thanks to the increasing popularity of the rural amateur basketball competition, surrounding villages have seen waves of visitors.\nAmid the robust recovery of China's domestic tourism industry this year, college students have played a significant role in contributing to the resurgence. They jokingly describe their approach to travel as \"commando-style tourism.\" This description reflects the prevailing tendency among university students and young people to visit numerous attractions and enjoy a variety of foods, all while keeping both time and costs to a minimum.\n\nThis aerial photo taken on April 30, 2023 shows tourists visiting the ancient city wall scenic spot in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province. (Xinhua/Liu Xiao)\nThe Chinese character for \"zhen,\" meaning \"self-inspire,\" has been chosen as Character of the Year 2023 in China, according to a recent event jointly held by the National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center, the Commercial Press, and Xinhuanet.\n\"Zhen\" applies when a person manages to stay true to his or her ideals in the face of challenges, continues to march despite wind and rain, and feels the joy resulting from every inch of progress, experts said.\n\"The annual buzzwords, with their continuity and positivity, to some extent reflect the stability of social development and the level of civilization,\" said Wang, adding that the future holds the promise of more \"key phrases\" that will embody the Chinese people's aspirations for a better life.\n(Video reporters: Yang Yanbin, Liu Qinbing, Wu Siyang, Cui Xiaoqiang, Cheng Ji'an; video editors: Zhang Nan, Li Qin.)  ■"

    "content": "BEIJING, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The fact that some Western politicians and media outlets are practicing double standards on human rights and using it as a weapon in an information war against China is becoming the consensus of more and more people.\nExamples of Western hypocrisy include allegations concerning boarding schools in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region and so-called \"forced labor\" in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China.\nBoarding schools are common in China and the world. In sparsely-populated Xizang, it ensures fair education. These schools, which are totally voluntary, provide traditional culture courses, such as Tibetan language and literature and folk dance and traditional food. Students are free to wear traditional dresses at school.\nIt must be pointed out that boarding schools in Xizang are totally different from those aimed at \"forced assimilation\" in history in some Western powers. For example, in the 19th and 20 centuries, Indian children in the United States were forced to attend boarding schools and banned from speaking their native language, wearing their traditional clothes, or carrying out traditional activities, thus erasing their language, culture and identity in an act of cultural genocide.\nThe attacks and smear campaigns against boarding schools in Xizang amount to attempts to destroy the children's right to education and depriving the region of its right to development and progress.\nLies are lies. The \"forced labor\" in Xinjiang, which some Western countries have alleged, is the same kind of lies with the same despicable purposes. An audit commissioned by Volkswagen has been a slap in the face for rumormongers. No indication of forced labor was found at the company's plant in Xinjiang, the German carmaker said in December last year.\nThe myth of \"forced labor\" in Xinjiang has also been debunked by other firms. Responding to reports alleging forced labor at a shoe factory in south China it sources products from, Skechers said in a March 2021 statement that none of its multiple audits of the factory -- in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 -- had revealed any indication of the use of forced labor or other concerning labor conditions.\nAs a matter of fact, the United States is fraught with serious forced labor. The University of Denver's website disclosed that there are currently at least 500,000 people living under modern slavery and forced labor in the United States. Forced labor is a particularly prominent and prevalent issue across 23 industries, such as domestic service, agriculture, planting, tourism sales, catering, medical care and beauty.\nBoth Xizang and Xinjiang have achieved unprecedented progress in human rights. The two autonomous regions are the epitome of China's human rights development and progress. With a people-centered human rights philosophy, China has found a path toward better human rights that follows the trend of the times and fits its national realities, and made historic progress in its human rights cause, with people from all ethnic groups enjoying a greater sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security.\nChina's human rights progress has gained prevailing recognition internationally. Western lies will never cover up the truth and the facts, only to expose more about the true hypocrisy and double standards of the rumormongers.  ■"

In recent weeks, the Red Sea tensions, increasing attacks on U.S. and Israeli bases in Iraq, and Iranian strikes on targets in neighboring countries, along with the Israel-Lebanon border tension that started on Oct. 8, 2023, have again fueled speculation of a wider war.\nDANGEROUS ESCALATION\nOn Jan. 12, the United States and Britain launched joint airstrikes on the targets of the Houthi group in Yemen. Washington said the strikes were in \"direct response\" to the repeated attacks on Red Sea ships that had been launched by the Houthis since November last year. The Houthis have been targeting ships that they claim have links to Israel, to retaliate the latter's war in Gaza.\nOver the past week, the U.S. military launched five raids targeting Houthi missile launch locations, the U.S. military's Central Command announced Saturday on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. Meanwhile, the Houthi group vowed its attacks on Israeli, U.S., and British ships in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea would continue until Israel ends its war and siege on the Gaza Strip.\nThe Red Sea tension chimed with other conflicts in the region. At least two members of the Hezbollah armed group were killed by an Israeli drone in a southern Lebanese village on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 227 on the Lebanese side since the outbreak of the Israel-Lebanon border confrontation.\nThe Israeli drone attack followed a missile strike that hit a residential neighborhood in the Syrian capital Damascus on Saturday, in which five officers of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) were killed.\nLast week, Iran launched attacks on targets in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan within 48 hours. Iran said the missile strikes targeted the bases of \"terrorists\" in Syria and Israel's intelligence service Mossad in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Irritated by the move, Iraq recalled its ambassador from Tehran and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Baghdad, and Pakistan carried out deadly retaliatory strikes against \"terrorist\" hideouts in an Iranian province.\nThe events of the past few days have demonstrated how a major confrontation, such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, could potentially set off a chain reaction that results in more tensions and cross-border attacks in the Middle East, said Wang Guangda, secretary-general of the China-Arab Research Center on Reform and Development at Shanghai International Studies University.\nSPILLOVERS OF TENSIONS\nGiven that the Red Sea is vital to international trade and that the Middle East has the world's largest reserves of oil and other energy resources, the escalation of tension has had devastating economic effects, and countries in the region are the first ones to bear the brunt.\nShip traffic in the Suez Canal, which provides the shortest sea route between Europe and Asia, had decreased by 30 percent since the beginning of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, due to recent tensions in the Red Sea, said Chairman of Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) Osama Rabie.\nIn a report on global economic prospects released this month, the World Bank said \"recent attacks on commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea have already started to disrupt key shipping routes, eroding slack in supply networks and increasing the likelihood of inflationary bottlenecks.\"\n\"This would have significant spillovers to other commodity prices and heighten geopolitical and economic uncertainty, which in turn could dampen investment and lead to a further weakening of growth,\" it noted.\nSome of the world's largest shipping companies have been forced to circumvent the Red Sea and sought an alternative route for Europe-Asia trade that passes the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, which increases the time of the voyage and shipping expenses.\n\"If left unchecked, the deteriorating security situation could once again detonate the Middle East,\" said Nadhum Ali, an Iraqi political expert and a member of the Arab Forum for Analyzing Iranian Policies.\nThe Middle East is an important energy and commodity transportation hub, and a major conflict in the region will shatter the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, he said.\nCROSSROAD FOR MIDEAST\nNotwithstanding the recent round of escalating tension, many observers believe Iran wants to avoid a direct military conflict with either Israel or the United States, but is prepared to mobilize its allies to keep U.S. and Israeli armies busy in the Middle East.\n\"At present, the possibility of a direct military conflict between Iran and the United States is relatively low,\" said Imad Salem, a Damascus-based Syrian political expert.\nBy launching the attacks last week, Iran is clearly warning Israel and the United States that any action against the Islamic countries will receive a similar or even tougher response, he said, adding that Iran also wants to signal its readiness to face an escalation of regional conflicts.\nRegarding the Israeli-Hezbollah confrontation, Eyal Pinko, an intelligence and national security expert at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies in Israel, said, \"the Biden administration doesn't want to go to war, so it puts pressure on Israel not to begin a war.\"\nAnalysts say escalated military tensions in the Middle East are not an ideal option for the Biden administration, which has been deeply involved in the Ukraine crisis and faces a tough reelection race in 2024.\nMoreover, a wider-ranging conflict is not in the interests of the big powers in the region.\nSalem blamed the biased Mideast policies of the United States for contributing to the latest round of tensions, which he said was a spillover of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\"In order to fundamentally resolve the current regional tension and conflict, the Palestinian issue must be resolved in a fair and just manner,\" he said.  ■"

    "content": "\nThis aerial photo taken on Dec. 27, 2023 shows the container yard at Qingdao Port, east China's Shandong Province. (Photo by Zhang Jingang/Xinhua)\nBEIJING, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) -- Two years on, the world's largest free trade pact in terms of population and trade volume, has unleashed tremendous benefits for regional integration in the Asia-Pacific region and powered up economic recovery.\nThe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which entered into force on Jan. 1, 2022, comprises 15 Asia-Pacific countries -- 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. Together, they cover about 30 percent of the world's population and 30 percent of global economic and trade volume.\nThe ASEAN remained China's largest trading partner in the first 11 months of 2023, with total trade between the two sides reaching 5.8 trillion yuan (about 817 billion U.S. dollars), according to the General Administration of Customs.\nDuring recent global economic challenges, the RCEP played a crucial role in stabilizing the economies of its member countries.\n\"It has helped member countries to boost post-pandemic recovery and sustainable long-term economic growth, contributing to enhancing regional peace, stability, harmony, development and prosperity,\" said the Cambodian Ministry of Commerce's Secretary of State and Spokesperson Penn Sovicheat.\nThanks to preferential tariffs under the RCEP agreement, Cambodia's trade with other pact members has surged. Cambodia exported products worth 7.21 billion U.S. dollars to RCEP members in the first 11 months of 2023, up 27 percent from 5.67 billion dollars in the same period of 2022.\nIn the first 10 months of 2023, the total value of China-Malaysia bilateral trade reached 155.73 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 20.8 percent of China's total trade with the ASEAN during this period.\nThe RCEP agreement covers various areas such as tariff reductions, trade facilitation, and the opening up of services and investment, highlighting the importance of multilateralism and an open world economy.\nIn November 2023, Chinese authorities issued 19,834 certificates of origin worth 568 million U.S. dollars under the RCEP agreement. The number of such certificates, issued to 3,434 enterprises, grew by 12.41 percent compared with the previous year, and these are expected to reduce tariffs for Chinese products by 9 million dollars in RCEP importing countries.\nChina remains committed to high-quality RCEP implementation to promote regional economic integration. Undoubtedly, the RCEP serves as a gateway allowing other member countries to also benefit from China's development opportunities.\nIn 2024, the continued success of this free trade pact will serve as a steadfast pillar, offering stability and certainty amid global economic recovery and challenges. The sustained dividends of this pact are sure to persist.  ■"

    "content": "\nA drone photo shows tourists having fun in front of a giant snowman near the Songhua River in Harbin, the capital city of China's northernmost province of Heilongjiang, on Jan. 9, 2024. (Xinhua/Zhang Tao)\nBEIJING, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite the skeptical outlook portrayed by many Western media regarding the Chinese economy in 2024, the unfolding reality reveals a different narrative. This year kicked off with a robust showcase of economic vitality.\nInstead of sluggish signs, the new year has been accompanied by booming consumption and tourism markets. According to data released by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, during the three-day New Year holiday, there were 135 million domestic tourist trips, marking an increase of 155.3 percent compared to the same period in 2023.\nThe tourism fever is particularly evident in Harbin, the capital of China's northernmost province of Heilongjiang, which recently gained traction for its snowy scenes and warm hospitality. During this year's three-day New Year holiday, it received some 3.05 million tourists, a record high, bringing in a tourism revenue of 5.91 billion yuan (about 832 million U.S. dollars).\nThis traveling feat did not come out of nowhere. Provincial regions such as Beijing, Hunan, and Guangdong have enhanced the consumer experience by laying out measures such as distributing consumer vouchers, reducing or exempting entrance fees, and organizing themed events to stimulate consumption. These efforts all aim to better meet the diverse and quality-oriented consumption needs of the public.\nBeyond the travel sector, China's manufacturing industry has also exhibited robust growth, and this trend is projected to continue this year.\nThe past year has seen both the production and sales volume of the Chinese automobile industry reach historic highs, hitting 30.16 million and 30.09 million units, respectively, and marking a year-on-year increase of 11.6 percent and 12 percent. The production and sales number of new energy vehicles grew 35.8 percent and 37.9 percent, respectively.\nThere have also been other achievements that indicate a good start to the year. On Tuesday, China's self-developed passenger aircraft C919 commenced operation on a new route connecting the megacities of Beijing and Shanghai, and China's first domestically-built large cruise ship, the Adora Magic City, completed its maiden commercial voyage on Sunday.\nAs China is keen to promote industrial innovation through technological innovation, foster new industries, new models and growth drivers, and develop new productive forces, the endogenous growth momentum of the Chinese economy is expected to further increase this year. More new bright spots in economic growth are set to emerge with the support of numerous policies and consistent advancements in various sectors.\nEchoing the proverb -- a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step -- these accomplishments establish a foundation for upcoming success, signaling that China's economy is heading in a promising direction. Despite the challenges that lie ahead, China's economy has demonstrated that determination and confidence can overcome any obstacle, and it is actively embracing a good start in 2024.\nEncouraging industrial news and hard work in multiple fields since the start of 2024 attest to the confidence in China's high-quality development. With down-to-earth efforts, the resilient Chinese economy is well capable of rising to the challenges both at home and abroad, fostering vibrant growth drivers and sustaining its role as a major engine for the global economy in the new year.  ■"

Only through exchange can we pool wisdom and create a better future, with more and broader mutually beneficial cooperation.\nWith a unique civilization that has endured for 5,000 years, China has been drawing wisdom from its traditional culture for its state governance and the advancement of Chinese modernization, providing its solutions to aid in improving global governance.\nThe events China has held this year have been concrete efforts to uphold the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. China proposed these four initiatives in recent years to tackle growing deficits in peace, development, security and governance, and to build a community with a shared future for all. The initiatives themselves have been widely discussed and supported at international events.\n\"China's ideas and proposals have won wide support. China's constructive role as a responsible major country has become more prominent,\" commented Chen Xulong, a professor of international relations at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\nAs a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the world's second-largest economy and the largest developing country, China has been a consistent promoter of and contributor to world peace and development, and a powerhouse of the world economy. China has also benefited significantly from its deeper global integration.\nA world with more exchanges and mutual understanding means greater solidarity and strength. As an important hub for global exchanges, China is set to work with the world to tackle issues of common concern and creat more opportunities for shared development and prosperity.  ■"

    "content": "HONG KONG, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Chinese president, will pay a state visit to Vietnam from Dec. 12 to 13 at the invitation of the Vietnamese side.\nSix years after his last Vietnam trip, Xi's upcoming visit is bound to consolidate political mutual trust between the two countries, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation.\nThe trip will also tighten the bond between the two peoples, and provide a strong impetus for ushering in a new stage in bilateral relations at a higher starting point.\nOver the years, both countries have witnessed frequent high-level exchanges and breakthroughs in practical cooperation, and their relations have seen ever-deepening popular support. Their special bond of \"camaraderie and brotherhood\" has benefited the two peoples and facilitated regional and world peace and development.\nThe friendship, deeply rooted in shared ideals and beliefs of the two countries with the same social system, has been epitomized in their respective foreign policies that regard the bilateral relationship as a priority.\nLeaders of both sides have also established solid political mutual trust and profound comradeship to chart the course for future growth of bilateral relations and provide important strategic guidance.\nIn October, Xi met with Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong, who was in Beijing for the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Exactly a year earlier, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong became the first foreign leader to visit China after the 20th CPC National Congress and was awarded the Friendship Medal of the People's Republic of China by Xi. Reciprocal visits of both leaders took place in 2017, with Xi's state visit to Vietnam being his first overseas trip after the 19th CPC National Congress.\nIt was during Xi's 2017 state visit to Vietnam when a memorandum of understanding was signed on the joint implementation of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Vietnam's \"Two Corridors and One Economic Circle\" plan, resulting in major projects that substantially improved the wellbeing of the people.\nTake Vietnam's first city metro. The 13-km Cat Linh-Ha Dong line with 12 stations and covering three districts in Hanoi, provided convenient and comfortable alternatives to traffic for commuters in the city crowded with millions of motorbikes and cars. Built by China and run by Vietnam, the metro line has demonstrated how the two countries are pushing forward practical cooperation.\nTheir cooperation has reached a higher level as the two countries mark the 15th anniversary of their comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership this year. China has remained Vietnam's biggest trading partner for years, while Vietnam has been China's biggest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\nAfter Vietnamese durians officially entered the Chinese market last year, its vegetable and fruit exports to China has been remarkably expanding this year, with its durian exports expected to top the goal of 1 billion U.S. dollars.\nMoreover, Chinese investment in Vietnam has been on the rise, ranking second in the first nine months of this year. Personnel exchanges also bounced back and are expected to grow as more flights resume.\nCloser bond and better understanding between the two peoples has been borne out by the increasing popularity of Chinese films and TV series among Vietnamese audience. And more Chinese tourists choose Vietnam as their destination, while more Vietnamese students opt to study and work in China.\nBoth China and Vietnam see the other's development as its own opportunity for development, and the prospects are bright for the two countries to work together in following the path of socialism and further promoting bilateral ties.\nIt is important for the two neighbors to actively promote mutually beneficial cooperation at sea, prevent the involvement of external forces, accelerate consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and make the South China Sea a sea of peace and cooperation.\nThe two sides should view their relations from the strategic perspective of promoting human progress and boosting the strength of socialism, said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi while co-chairing the 15th meeting of the Steering Committee for Bilateral Cooperation in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi earlier this month.\nWhile meeting with Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Nguyen Phu Trong said he planted a friendship tree at the Youyi Pass, or Friendship Pass, on the China-Vietnam border, stressing that the border port, the only one named after friendship among neighbors, highlighted the traditional friendship cherished by Vietnam.\nThe world today is living through accelerating changes unseen in a century. Socialist countries such as China and Vietnam, based on their national conditions and in line with the trend of the times, have successfully explored their own modernization paths.\nWith shared aspiration and joint efforts, the giant ship of China-Vietnam friendship will surely sail toward greater success.  ■"

    "content": "by Xinhua writer Gao Wencheng\nDAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- During this year's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, Chinese Premier Li Qiang conveyed a resolute message to the world: China has an unwavering commitment to sharing opportunities with others.\nTo begin with, the opportunities created by China stem from a colossal market with a rapidly urbanizing population of 1.4 billion people. The sheer size of the population generates substantial demand for a diverse range of goods and services, offering global businesses an unparalleled market.\nIn the automotive sector, both Chinese automakers such as BYD and their foreign counterparts such as Tesla have witnessed a surge in market share in China. Data indicate that Tesla's share of China's electric vehicle market grew to 12 percent in the first 10 months of 2023, up from 10 percent in 2022. Reuters highlighted Tesla's robust sales performance in China as a \"rare bright spot\" for the electric vehicle maker.\nThe opportunities also arise from China's unwavering commitment to economic openness. Currently, China is a pivotal trading partner for over 140 countries and regions, with the overall tariff level reduced to 7.3 percent, approaching that of developed World Trade Organization (WTO) members. Over the last five years, the return on foreign direct investment in China has averaged around 9 percent, a relatively high figure internationally.\nIn his special address, Li expressed China's warm welcome for investments from businesses of all countries. He said China will steadily expand institutional opening-up, continue to shorten the negative list for foreign investment, and provide national treatment for foreign businesses. China's favorable business environment, coupled with various policy initiatives, encourages multinational corporations to expand their presence in the country.\nFor instance, BASF, the prominent German chemicals company, is investing up to 10 billion euros (about 10.7 billion U.S. dollars) in China through 2030. French cosmetics giant L'Oreal has founded its first investment company in China and L'Oreal Chairman Jean-Paul Agon said \"we believe that investing in China is investing in the future.\"\nAlthough the U.S. government is encouraging the largest companies to reduce their exposure to China, the first China International Supply Chain Expo, held at the end of 2023, saw U.S. companies constituting a solid 20 percent of foreign exhibitors, demonstrating China's irreplaceable role in global supply chains. Despite political pressure, U.S. businesses are voting with their feet, opposing decoupling.\nSimultaneously, China's focus on innovation and technology has propelled it to the forefront of various industries. From telecommunications to electric vehicles, the country's advancements create collaborative opportunities for global enterprises seeking to engage with cutting-edge technologies.\nThe success of foreign investments in China sharply contrasts with the challenges faced by Chinese companies in Western markets.\nMeasures such as Washington enacting the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" and Brussels initiating an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles are seen by many as counterproductive. Analysts caution that Western attempts to exclude China from supply chains risk increased costs, reduced demand, and potentially \"pushing themselves into a corner\" by hindering ambitious pursuits like climate transitions.\nMoreover, recent research sheds light on how reducing reliance on Chinese supply chains would bring increasing costs and complexities for all involved.\nFindings from an October paper by researchers at the Bank for International Settlements indicate that cross-border supplier networks, especially those involving China and the United States, have lengthened since 2021 without becoming more \"dense.\" Essentially, this means that the average number of suppliers per customer hasn't increased. The Wall Street Journal noted that the emergence of more circuitous supply chains with the same number of suppliers hints at heightened complexity and reduced transparency, without necessarily enhancing resilience.\nFor other countries, cooperation with China and the interdependence that comes with it is a potential boon, not a risk.\nAt a time when the world economy faces genuine risks such as tight financial conditions, geopolitical rifts, and rapid advances in generative artificial intelligence, as highlighted in the latest Chief Economists Outlook released by the WEF, cooperation with China and the opportunities it brings are needed more than ever.  ■"

    "content": "\nChinese Premier Li Qiang attends the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2024 hosted by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 16, 2024. (Xinhua/Rao Aimin)\nFor other countries, cooperation with China and the interdependence that comes with it is a potential boon, not a risk.\nby Xinhua writer Gao Wencheng\nDAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- During this year's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting, Chinese Premier Li Qiang conveyed a resolute message to the world: China has an unwavering commitment to sharing opportunities with others.\nTo begin with, the opportunities created by China stem from a colossal market with a rapidly urbanizing population of 1.4 billion people. The sheer size of the population generates substantial demand for a diverse range of goods and services, offering global businesses an unparalleled market.\nIn the automotive sector, both Chinese automakers such as BYD and their foreign counterparts such as Tesla have witnessed a surge in market share in China. Data indicate that Tesla's share of China's electric vehicle market grew to 12 percent in the first 10 months of 2023, up from 10 percent in 2022. Reuters highlighted Tesla's robust sales performance in China as a \"rare bright spot\" for the electric vehicle maker.\nThe opportunities also arise from China's unwavering commitment to economic openness. Currently, China is a pivotal trading partner for over 140 countries and regions, with the overall tariff level reduced to 7.3 percent, approaching that of developed World Trade Organization (WTO) members. Over the last five years, the return on foreign direct investment in China has averaged around 9 percent, a relatively high figure internationally.\nIn his special address, Li expressed China's warm welcome for investments from businesses of all countries. He said China will steadily expand institutional opening-up, continue to shorten the negative list for foreign investment, and provide national treatment for foreign businesses. China's favorable business environment, coupled with various policy initiatives, encourages multinational corporations to expand their presence in the country.\nFor instance, BASF, the prominent German chemicals company, is investing up to 10 billion euros (about 10.7 billion U.S. dollars) in China through 2030. French cosmetics giant L'Oreal has founded its first investment company in China and L'Oreal Chairman Jean-Paul Agon said \"we believe that investing in China is investing in the future.\"\nAlthough the U.S. government is encouraging the largest companies to reduce their exposure to China, the first China International Supply Chain Expo, held at the end of 2023, saw U.S. companies constituting a solid 20 percent of foreign exhibitors, demonstrating China's irreplaceable role in global supply chains. Despite political pressure, U.S. businesses are voting with their feet, opposing decoupling.\n\nVehicle carrier vessel \"BYD EXPLORER NO.1\" arrives at Xiaomo International Logistics Port in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, Jan. 14, 2024. (Xinhua)\nSimultaneously, China's focus on innovation and technology has propelled it to the forefront of various industries. From telecommunications to electric vehicles, the country's advancements create collaborative opportunities for global enterprises seeking to engage with cutting-edge technologies.\nThe success of foreign investments in China sharply contrasts with the challenges faced by Chinese companies in Western markets.\nMeasures such as Washington enacting the \"Inflation Reduction Act\" and Brussels initiating an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles are seen by many as counterproductive. Analysts caution that Western attempts to exclude China from supply chains risk increased costs, reduced demand, and potentially \"pushing themselves into a corner\" by hindering ambitious pursuits like climate transitions.\nMoreover, recent research sheds light on how reducing reliance on Chinese supply chains would bring increasing costs and complexities for all involved.\nFindings from an October paper by researchers at the Bank for International Settlements indicate that cross-border supplier networks, especially those involving China and the United States, have lengthened since 2021 without becoming more \"dense.\" Essentially, this means that the average number of suppliers per customer hasn't increased. The Wall Street Journal noted that the emergence of more circuitous supply chains with the same number of suppliers hints at heightened complexity and reduced transparency, without necessarily enhancing resilience.\nFor other countries, cooperation with China and the interdependence that comes with it is a potential boon, not a risk.\nAt a time when the world economy faces genuine risks such as tight financial conditions, geopolitical rifts, and rapid advances in generative artificial intelligence, as highlighted in the latest Chief Economists Outlook released by the WEF, cooperation with China and the opportunities it brings are needed more than ever.■"

Since then, countless heartfelt stories about Chinese medical personnel have surfaced, showcasing their significant contributions to global public health and the well-being of people worldwide.\nTREATMENT\nEthiopian resident Gezahegn Tilahun endured a \"mysterious illness\" for over two years, losing 21 kg of weight and experiencing sallow skin and eyes. He visited four hospitals without finding the cause of the pain.\nHe was finally received by the Armed Forces Comprehensive Specialized Hospital of Ethiopia, where Chinese medical teams have been offering aid for nine years, and was diagnosed with a pancreatic tumor.\nDespite the hospital's lack of prior experience in such surgeries, Wang Xiaojun, leader of the 9th medical team sent to Ethiopia, collaborated with local doctors to perform an 8-hour-long lifesaving operation on Tilahun, earning recognition from Ethiopian colleagues.\n\"My true gratitude is beyond words. The doctors have given me a brand-new life,\" said Tilahun.\n\"As a mother, I was overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty. It is your calmness and professionalism that gave me hope and comfort.\" This was from a handwritten letter from Josephine Inapi to a Chinese medical team in Papua New Guinea for saving her newborn baby's life.\nIn May, Inapi's less than one-month-old baby faced severe health issues. Despite treatment with antibiotics and pulmonary artery pressure-lowering medications, the baby's oxygen saturation continued to drop, posing a grave risk of multi-organ damage, and cardiac and respiratory arrest.\n\nMembers of a medical team pose for a group photo before departure for Barbados to provide medical aid, in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, Sept. 8, 2023. (Xinhua)\nThanks to the collaboration between the Chinese medical team and local experts from the Port Moresby General Hospital, including the introduction of neonatal mechanical ventilation skills, the baby's vital signs returned to normal.\nTo express her gratitude, Inapi asked for a Chinese name for her baby to commemorate the Chinese doctors.\nLiu Zhenqiu, the Chinese medical team leader, named the boy \"Taile,\" which is pronounced similar to \"Taylor\" in English, symbolizing \"safety\" and \"happiness\" in Chinese.\nSHARING\nApart from providing treatment for the patients, Chinese medical teams also shared their expertise and technologies with local doctors.\nIn the same hospital where Inapi's baby stayed, a local doctor recently performed the country's first laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery under the guidance of Xian Peng, a urologist from the 12th Chinese medical team.\n\"We should not only introduce new technologies but also make them take root here. Therefore, we carry out training for the local doctors,\" Xian said, adding that the Chinese medical team has organized a series of training courses for the local doctors since February this year.\nStatistics revealed that Chinese medical teams dispatched abroad have trained over 100,000 local medical personnel, significantly enhancing the healthcare expertise in recipient countries.\nChina's altruistic medical assistance has garnered immense appreciation globally.\nOn Dec. 1, a medical expert team from China dispatched to Laos was awarded a medal for their outstanding contributions to medical aid in the country.\nThe medical team of 10 members arrived in Laos in June, said Cai Yue, the team leader, adding that they helped establish Laos' first chest pain treatment center, organized a medical academic exchange conference, and introduced advanced concepts in medical technology and management.\n\nCai Yue, team leader of a medical expert team of the People's Liberation Army of China dispatched to Laos receives a medal awarded by the Lao People's Army, in Vientiane, Laos, on Dec. 1, 2023. (Xinhua)\nStatistics from China's National Health Commission indicated that China has so far initiated pair-up cooperation with 46 medical institutions in 41 countries and regions. Although the medical teams cannot stay there forever, the methods and technologies they provide continue to benefit the local people.\nChinese medical teams have also introduced Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) overseas. In many countries, acupuncture has become a popular choice for patients.\n\"The locals know little about the TCM and stay doubtful at the beginning. However, many patients become TCM fans after experiencing its curative effects,\" said Liu Chun, a veteran member of Chinese medical teams who has been dispatched to Kuwait three times. TCM treatments have successfully aided local patients in recovering from conditions like tinnitus and facial paralysis.\nSix decades on, the determination and spirit of Chinese medical team members have been passed down through generations. At present, Chinese medical teams are still braving various diseases and sowing the seeds of health in 56 countries.\n(Video reporters: Yang Shiyan, Wang Ping; video editors: Wu You, Mu Xuyao, Zhang Yuhong, Jia Xiaotong, Ma Ruxuan.) ■\n"

(Xinhua/Guo Xulei)\nBEIJING, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- With a tone-setting conference mapping out priorities for its economic work in the coming year, China has unequivocally signaled its capability and confidence in confronting challenges on the path to securing stronger growth momentum.\nDuring the annual Central Economic Work Conference which concluded on Tuesday, policymakers underscored the country's dedication to boosting economic vitality, preventing and mitigating risks, improving social expectations, and consolidating and promoting the momentum of economic growth next year.\nIn the face of rising complexity and uncertainty in the external environment and arduous tasks in promoting reform, development and stability at home, the meeting pointed out that China still has to overcome some difficulties and challenges to further revive its economy.\nFrom introducing more policies that help stabilize expectations, growth and employment to strengthening the consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation, the measures laid out at the conference were targeted and forceful.\nPolicy priorities were outlined in nine major areas including sci-tech innovation, reforms, domestic demand and opening up, providing comprehensive solutions to both short-term and longer-range problems in the economy.\nThe messages emanating from the conference demonstrated the clear-headedness of the country's leadership as well as their prowess in managing the overall economic situation.\nThe Chinese economy has secured steady growth throughout 2023, expanding 5.2 percent year on year in the first three quarters, outpacing other major economies globally and remaining on track to achieve its growth target of around 5 percent for this year.\nThis hard-earned upturn served as strong evidence of how effective China's policy maneuvering was in response to headwinds both at home and abroad. Despite certain difficulties and challenges, such as lack of effective demand and lackluster social expectations, there are good reasons to remain optimistic about the country's economic governance.\nStressing high-quality development, the meeting underscored the role of sci-tech innovation in building a modern industrial system, arranged a slew of policies to expand domestic demand, and planned deepened reforms related to state-owned enterprises and the private economy.\nIt also urged active and prudent efforts to defuse risks in the property sector, a traditional cornerstone of the Chinese economy, offering recipes including equally meeting the reasonable financing needs of real estate enterprises with different ownership forms.\nAll these arrangements have responded to key problems facing high-quality development and provided clear solutions for these problems, showing that policymakers are solution-oriented, pragmatic and forward-looking, which will serve as a shot in the arm for economic growth.\nThere are abundant grounds for confidence. The fundamental positive trend of the Chinese economy has not changed, as shown by rebounding consumer spending, stable employment, growing resident income, improving foreign trade, expanding industrial production and a robust high-tech sector.\nIn recognition of the economy's sound revival, international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently raised their growth forecasts for China, citing favorable prospects.\nDespite domestic and external uncertainties, China possesses numerous advantages that help solidify its long-term positive economic fundamentals, including an enormous consumer market, a well-rounded industrial system, increasing openness to the world, and adequate macroeconomic policy space.\nWith its immense potential and sound governance, the Chinese economy is poised to navigate all twists and turns on the road to prosperity and steer toward a brighter future.  ■"

    "content": "\nThis photo taken on Feb. 15, 2023 shows a factory of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Li Auto Inc. in Changzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province. (Xinhua/Li Bo)\nAlthough there will be various setbacks and difficulties on the way forward, China has chosen the right development path and direction, and promoting a high-level opening-up will make China one of the most important and successful countries in the world in the 21st century, said Jim Rogers, a world-renowned investor and financial commentator.\nBEIJING, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- After some setbacks on the post-COVID 19 recovery path, the Chinese economy has once again shown its resilience and great potential as it regained momentum in the third quarter, expanding by a higher-than-expected 5.2 percent.\nAgainst the backdrop of multiple uncertainties in the global economy, many international institutions have recently upgraded China's economic growth forecasts, with the figures for 2023 all above 5 percent. Some analysts have predicted an even higher growth for 2024.\nThese positive signs, which came as a result of a series of forceful and pragmatic policies and measures implemented by the Chinese government to stabilize growth and promote an opening-up, have not only given the world a great boost of confidence, but also once again proved the vicious \"China collapse\" rhetoric wrong.\nSince the beginning of this year, the global economy has been struggling under the impact of geopolitical crises, the spillover effect of the U.S. fiscal and monetary policies, and the so-called \"de-risking\" of supply chains by some Western countries.\nThe Chinese economy has also met with many challenges: persistent global inflationary pressure, a deteriorating trade environment, and sluggish international market demand, among others. To overcome the difficulties, China has given priority to stability while pursuing progress, rolling out a comprehensive package of macro-control policies.\nSince the second quarter, the United Nations has taken the lead in raising China's economic growth forecast for this year. Recently after the release of the faster-than-expected figures for the third quarter, more institutions have followed suit.\nIn its mid-year update of the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2023, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs raised its forecast for China's economic growth this year to 5.3 percent from 4.8 at the beginning of the year. The International Monetary Fund recently announced that it expects China's economy to grow by 5.4 percent in 2023, higher than previously expected. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development raised the figure to 5.2 percent from 5 percent. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast to 5.1 percent from 4.8-4.9 percent. Citigroup raised its forecast to 5.3 percent from 5 percent.\nThese bullish predictions have a solid basis. Figures from the National Statistics Office show that China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.2 percent year-on-year in the first three quarters of this year, one of the fastest among major economies in the world. From January to October, 41,947 new foreign-invested enterprises were established in China, up 32.1 percent year on year. The actual investment in China by Canada, Britain, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands increased by 110.3 percent, 94.6 percent, 90.0 percent, 66.1 percent and 33.0 percent, respectively.\nMarcos Pires, director of the Institute of Economics and International Studies at Sao Paulo State University in Brazil, said that China's economy is not only growing steadily, but also improving in quality. China's clean energy sector, driven by the rapid development of new energy power generation equipment, battery and electric vehicle industries, \"has become the undisputed leader in the world in just a few years.\"\n\nPeople visit the 2023 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) at China National Convention Center in Beijing, capital of China, Sept. 4, 2023. (Xinhua/Wu Wei)\nThe accelerating recovery of the Chinese economy pronounced the failure of the so-called \"de-coupling\" or \"de-risking\" tricks by some Western politicians. They might create a temporary headwind down the road, but China's vigorous economic development and its mutually-beneficial cooperation with the outside world won't be stopped.\n\"Since the beginning of this year, the media and politicians of some Western countries, including the United States, have said that China's economy is about to collapse, that China's economy is a time bomb, and that Chinese cities have become ghost cities,\" said renowned Australian economist Guo Shengxiang. \"These statements are pompous and out of touch with common sense.\"\nChina's economy has its own cycle, and the main direction is \"upward,\" Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in the United States, said. In the next 30 years, China will be a leader in digital technology, electric vehicles, renewable energy and many other fields of science and technology, he told Xinhua.\nThis year marks the 45th anniversary of China's opening-up policy. In recent years, China has been intensifying moves to promote a high-quality opening-up, setting up more and greater platforms for win-win cooperation for all parties, and earning more trust from the international community.\nChina applies the highest standards in implementing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, and has taken proactive steps to align its economic and trade rules with the high standards of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economic Partnership Agreement, improved the mechanism for protecting the rights and interests of foreign investment, further reduced the negative list for foreign investment access, and worked hard to break down barriers that restrict the flow of innovation factors.\nMore and more business people around the world are now assured of China's steadfast determination and capability to continuously push forward its opening-up and sincerity in contributing to global development from a win-win approach. The \"next China\" is still China, they say. \"Investing in China is investing in the future,\" they also say.\n\"China's commitment to high-level openness will benefit the entire world,\" said Jim Rogers, a world-renowned investor and financial commentator.\nIndeed, the institutional advantages of the socialist market economy, the strengths of its enormous market, the supply advantages of a full-fledged industrial system, and the talent advantages of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs are the basis for China's economy to forge ahead, and have been increasingly recognized by the outside world.\n\"China is now the economically indispensable nation in the world,\" said Khairy Tourk, professor of Economics at Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nVisitors look at a battery charging robot for new energy vehicles at the smart vehicle section of the China International Supply Chain Expo (CISIE) in Beijing, capital of China, Dec. 1, 2023.

    "content": "\nThis aerial photo taken on Jan. 1, 2024 shows the large cruise ship Adora Magic City at the Shanghai Wusongkou International Cruise Terminal in east China's Shanghai. (Xinhua/Ding Ting)\nby Xinhua writer Li Laifang\nBEIJING, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic product posted growth of 5.2 percent year on year in 2023, meeting the government's target of around 5 percent, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Wednesday.\nThe rate is much higher than the projected global growth rate of around 3 percent, and takes the leading position among the world's major economies. China's economy is expected to contribute more than 30 percent to world economic growth in 2023, and is the largest engine of world economic growth.\nThe performance manifests the resilience and capacity of the world's second-largest economy to further recover and progress in 2024, with the clear-minded leadership resolved to tackle domestic problems facing the economy and brave mounting uncertainties and unfavorable factors from the outside, releasing timely and pragmatic policies and measures for both the short-term and long run.\nIt has also taught those exaggerating naysayers a fresh lesson that their repeated theories about the collapse or crisis of the Chinese economy throughout last year have proved out-and-out fantasies, as they have been time and again.\nAs we observe the Chinese economic recovery, it should be noted that its feat of growth in terms of both quantity and quality has been secured as the nation withstood external pressures, overcame internal difficulties, and deepened reform and opening up, after three years of COVID-19 prevention and control.\nAlthough China's economic recovery experienced some fluctuations on a quarterly basis, its momentum never petered out. Rather, new tech-based growth drivers, ranging from the new-energy vehicle sector to smart and high-end manufacturing to artificial intelligence, have developed and expanded substantially, propelling the economy on a course of sustained overall recovery.\nFor example, investment in China's high-tech industries increased by 10.3 percent year on year in 2023. Specifically, investment in the sectors of high-tech manufacturing and high-tech services expanded by 9.9 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively, the NBS data showed.\n\nThe five millionth new energy vehicle produced by Chinese carmaker BYD rolls off production line in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, Aug. 9, 2023. (Xinhua/Liang Xu)\n2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and is a crucial year for implementing the country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025). But it is no easy task for China to do a good job of economic work and achieve further recovery in the coming year, given the various difficulties and challenges, including a lack of effective demand, weak social expectations, hidden risks, and an external environment that is increasingly complex, severe and uncertain.\nAccording to Gao Ruidong, chief economist at Everbright Securities, in the short term, the scarring effect of the pandemic, the overall downturn in overseas demand, and the \"de-risking\" measures adopted by Europe and the United States are among the factors leading to low consumption expectations and the weak investment confidence of enterprises, which necessitates more policies to stabilize growth and expectations.\nCiting mounting geopolitical tensions, lower demand in developed countries, an uptick in trade-restrictive measures, and elongated supply chains, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said the outlook for global trade in 2024 remains \"highly uncertain\" and \"generally pessimistic.\"\nYet the unique features and strengths of the Chinese economy provide the basic confidence, potential and strong resilience to address any problems and challenges that may lie ahead and to move upward, possibly amid twists and turns. China is the only country with industries across all categories in the U.N. industrial classification. The added value of China's manufacturing industry accounts for around 30 percent of the global total, ranking first in the world for 14 consecutive years. China's supersize market offers a big stage for various businesses and talents.\nFlourishing innovation creates new growth drivers in China. China has some 400,000 high-tech enterprises and ranks second globally in the number of unicorn companies. The number of invention patents in China grew 22.4 percent year on year to reach 4.02 million by the end of 2023, making the country the first in the world, with more than 4 million valid invention patents, official statistics show.\n\"China is sure to keep its overall trend of economic recovery and long-term improvement. The so-called 'Peak China' theory in the West is totally untenable,\" said Tang Duoduo, a researcher in macroeconomics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nWith solid and sound fundamentals, as well as huge growth space in fields such as green transformation and new urbanization, China's economy will remain steadfast as a major stabilizer and source of power of the global economic growth in the coming years.  ■"

Since then, countless heartfelt stories about Chinese medical personnel have surfaced, showcasing their significant contributions to global public health and the well-being of people worldwide.\nTREATMENT\nEthiopian resident Gezahegn Tilahun endured a \"mysterious illness\" for over two years, losing 21 kg of weight and experiencing sallow skin and eyes. He visited four hospitals without finding the cause of the pain.\nHe was finally received by the Armed Forces Comprehensive Specialized Hospital of Ethiopia, where Chinese medical teams have been offering aid for nine years, and was diagnosed with a pancreatic tumor.\nDespite the hospital's lack of prior experience in such surgeries, Wang Xiaojun, leader of the 9th medical team sent to Ethiopia, collaborated with local doctors to perform an 8-hour-long lifesaving operation on Tilahun, earning recognition from Ethiopian colleagues.\n\"My true gratitude is beyond words. The doctors have given me a brand-new life,\" said Tilahun.\n\"As a mother, I was overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty. It is your calmness and professionalism that gave me hope and comfort.\" This was from a handwritten letter from Josephine Inapi to a Chinese medical team in Papua New Guinea for saving her newborn baby's life.\nIn May, Inapi's less than one-month-old baby faced severe health issues. Despite treatment with antibiotics and pulmonary artery pressure-lowering medications, the baby's oxygen saturation continued to drop, posing a grave risk of multi-organ damage, and cardiac and respiratory arrest.\n\nMembers of a medical team pose for a group photo before departure for Barbados to provide medical aid, in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, Sept. 8, 2023. (Xinhua)\nThanks to the collaboration between the Chinese medical team and local experts from the Port Moresby General Hospital, including the introduction of neonatal mechanical ventilation skills, the baby's vital signs returned to normal.\nTo express her gratitude, Inapi asked for a Chinese name for her baby to commemorate the Chinese doctors.\nLiu Zhenqiu, the Chinese medical team leader, named the boy \"Taile,\" which is pronounced similar to \"Taylor\" in English, symbolizing \"safety\" and \"happiness\" in Chinese.\nSHARING\nApart from providing treatment for the patients, Chinese medical teams also shared their expertise and technologies with local doctors.\nIn the same hospital where Inapi's baby stayed, a local doctor recently performed the country's first laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery under the guidance of Xian Peng, a urologist from the 12th Chinese medical team.\n\"We should not only introduce new technologies but also make them take root here. Therefore, we carry out training for the local doctors,\" Xian said, adding that the Chinese medical team has organized a series of training courses for the local doctors since February this year.\nStatistics revealed that Chinese medical teams dispatched abroad have trained over 100,000 local medical personnel, significantly enhancing the healthcare expertise in recipient countries.\nChina's altruistic medical assistance has garnered immense appreciation globally.\nOn Dec. 1, a medical expert team from China dispatched to Laos was awarded a medal for their outstanding contributions to medical aid in the country.\nThe medical team of 10 members arrived in Laos in June, said Cai Yue, the team leader, adding that they helped establish Laos' first chest pain treatment center, organized a medical academic exchange conference, and introduced advanced concepts in medical technology and management.\n\nCai Yue, team leader of a medical expert team of the People's Liberation Army of China dispatched to Laos receives a medal awarded by the Lao People's Army, in Vientiane, Laos, on Dec. 1, 2023. (Xinhua)\nStatistics from China's National Health Commission indicated that China has so far initiated pair-up cooperation with 46 medical institutions in 41 countries and regions. Although the medical teams cannot stay there forever, the methods and technologies they provide continue to benefit the local people.\nChinese medical teams have also introduced Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) overseas. In many countries, acupuncture has become a popular choice for patients.\n\"The locals know little about the TCM and stay doubtful at the beginning. However, many patients become TCM fans after experiencing its curative effects,\" said Liu Chun, a veteran member of Chinese medical teams who has been dispatched to Kuwait three times. TCM treatments have successfully aided local patients in recovering from conditions like tinnitus and facial paralysis.\nSix decades on, the determination and spirit of Chinese medical team members have been passed down through generations. At present, Chinese medical teams are still braving various diseases and sowing the seeds of health in 56 countries.\n(Video reporters: Yang Shiyan, Wang Ping; video editors: Wu You, Mu Xuyao, Zhang Yuhong, Jia Xiaotong, Ma Ruxuan.) ■\n"

    "content": "by Xinhua writers Huang Yaoman, Jiang Fan and Lyu Qiuping\nLHASA, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Lhapa Dondrup is perhaps the shortest photographer in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region.\nStanding less than 1 meter tall, the wheelchair-bound Tibetan has brittle bone disease, which leads to frequent fractures. He is now 22 years old, despite doctors once predicting that he would never live beyond 20.\nHowever, his physical disability has not stopped him from chasing his dream of becoming a photographer.\n\"Photography reminds me of the time when I was confined to bed during childhood. Lying in bed, I found that the rays of light through the window were so beautiful,\" Lhapa Dondrup recalled, adding that photography is his way of holding onto the beautiful moments in life.\nSunday marks Human Rights Day.\nLhapa Dondrup was born into a farming family in the rural area of Lhasa, the regional capital. His mother died when he was young, so he was adopted by relatives.\nSuffering from frequent fractures, he was diagnosed with brittle bone disease at 5 years old. During second grade in primary school, he had an accident that almost killed him.\n\"I accidentally fell down, resulting in broken ribs, which pressed hard against my organs,\" Lhapa Dondrup recalled.\nConcerned about his safety, his adoptive parents asked him to drop out of school. Long periods at home left Lhapa Dondrup feeling depressed, considering himself a burden both to his family and to society.\nIn 2018, he was offered to study at the Lhasa care center for people with disabilities, a development that gave him renewed hope.\n\"My family didn't allow me to go because of their fears concerning my health condition. So I lied to them, promising to return following a brief visit. But I stayed and studied there for three years,\" he said with a smile.\nAt the center, Lhapa Dondrup not only learned Tibetan calligraphy and Mandarin writing but also chose to learn photography and video editing, both of which he enjoys.\nIn his words, photography is all about light, with a photo capturing the light at a particular moment.\nHe believes his photographs are unique. \"Because of my height, my point of view is lower than that of other people, so I hope to capture a peculiar type of light in life from my own angle,\" Lhapa Dondrup said.\nIn 2021, Lhapa Dondrup met Jole, a disabled entrepreneur who started a business for Tibetan calligraphy training and stationery sales. Of the 42 employees hired by his company, 27 have disabilities.\nInspired by Jole, Lhapa Dondrup asked to join the company.\nJole said Lhapa Dondrup is full of enthusiasm and ambition. \"Most importantly, he didn't give up on himself, so I hired him,\" said Jole.\nJole supports Lhapa Dondrup's photography dream, giving him company cameras and encouraging him to pursue his dream. Caring people have also donated photographic equipment and taught him about photography.\nLhapa Dondrup is responsible for taking promotional photos for the company, as well as online operations. He earns 2,500 yuan (about 351.5 U.S. dollars) as monthly basic pay, excluding bonus, and receives 600 yuan from the government as a subsidy for people with disabilities.\nLast year, Lhapa Dondrup bought new clothes and shoes for his adoptive parents with his own salary to celebrate the Tibetan New Year.\n\"My parents were so happy, and I felt proud and confident to be supporting myself with my own hands,\" he said.\nAccording to a white paper issued last month, a basic multi-tiered social security system has been established in Xizang. The surveyed urban unemployment rate has remained below the national average and the number of families with no one in work has been steadily reduced to zero, the paper said.\nFor Lhapa Dondrup, photography is more than just a way to make a living. In his spare time, he takes pictures of pet animals and people in Barkhor Street, a famous scenic and shopping area located at the heart of Lhasa. Driving a motor tricycle, he travels as far as possible.\nNext year, he plans to go to Beijing to visit his sister studying there.\n\"I want to take my camera to Tian'anmen Square and get some photos there,\" he said.  ■"

With a burgeoning demand for clean energy solutions to combat climate change, the global landscape indicates a pressing need for expanded production capabilities rather than an excess.\nAccording to projections by the International Energy Agency, the demand for new energy vehicles is anticipated to skyrocket, reaching 45 million by 2030, 4.5 times that of 2022. (Xinhua/Huang Wei)\nBEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- In the ongoing discourse surrounding the global new energy sector, the U.S. allegations of \"overcapacity\" in China starkly contradict the prevailing reality of significant undercapacity in the industry.\nWith a burgeoning demand for clean energy solutions to combat climate change, the global landscape indicates a pressing need for expanded production capabilities rather than an excess.\nThe characterization of overcapacity appears peculiar when people consider the innovative and tech-driven nature of the new energy industry, which embodies the growing trend of energy transition. This sector remains in its nascent stages of rapid growth, with the demand for new energy products outstripping current global capacity.\nAccording to projections by the International Energy Agency, the demand for new energy vehicles is anticipated to skyrocket, reaching 45 million by 2030, 4.5 times that of 2022. Similar exponential growth is expected in global demand for new photovoltaic installations. Aligning with these projections, the consensus reached at the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change also underscores the urgent need to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.\nOf particular note is the Sunnylands Statement on Enhancing Cooperation to Address the Climate Crisis, wherein China and the United States have reaffirmed their commitment to collaborative efforts in tackling climate change, including the support for tripling renewable energy capacity globally by 2030.\nDespite claims of overcapacity, there remains a consistent global demand for Chinese new energy products like vehicles and batteries, evidenced by many countries seeking investments from Chinese enterprises in this sector. Moreover, the significant policy backing from the United States, particularly through initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act, further emphasizes this disparity.\nThe escalating demand for new energy globally necessitates sustained efforts to expand production capacity, with China's robust development of the new energy industry playing a pivotal role in this endeavor. China's swift advancement in new energy technology, combined with its commitment to product quality, has earned growing recognition both at home and abroad.\nThe resilience and competitiveness of China's new energy products stem from various factors, including early investment in research and development, a comprehensive industrial chain, a vast domestic market, rapidly evolving infrastructure, and robust market competition encompassing state-owned, private and foreign entities.\nAllegations of overcapacity in China's new energy industry seem driven by protectionist motives. Rather than reducing China's capacity, the global community should strive for expanded investment and access to Chinese products to accelerate the energy transition. ■\n\nRobots work at an assembly line of FAW-Hongqi in Changchun, northeast China's Jilin Province, April 24, 2024.

    "content": "BEIJING, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- As 2023 draws to a close, Xinhua News Agency has curated a selection of top 10 news stories that defined the year in China. Join us as we recap the standout moments of 2023.\n1. \"Two sessions\" gather steam for China to forge ahead\nIn March, China convened the \"two sessions,\" which are the yearly gatherings of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). New leaders of state institutions and the CPPCC National Committee were elected during these sessions of the country's national legislative and political advisory bodies.\nOn March 10, Xi Jinping was unanimously elected Chinese president and chairman of the country's Central Military Commission at the third plenary meeting of the first session of the 14th NPC.\nThe \"two sessions\" have built consensus and strength for building a strong nation and advancing national rejuvenation, greatly inspiring the Chinese people, in their hundreds of millions, to rally even more closely around the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core and work together to achieve the goals and tasks set at the 20th CPC National Congress.\n2. New round of reform in Party and state institutions basically completed\nChina released a plan on reforming Party and state institutions on March 16.\nBy setting up the Central Financial Commission, a central commission for science and technology, a social work department of the CPC Central Committee, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration, among others, the reform has strengthened the CPC Central Committee's centralized, unified leadership on major initiatives.\nThe new round of reform in Party and state institutions provides strong support for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.\n3. Party-wide theoretical study program achieves notable progress\nDuring a theoretical study program that started in April, CPC members have focused on the study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in a top-down fashion.\nConcrete results have been achieved in forging inner strength, gaining wisdom, improving Party conduct and motivating actions among Party members through the program, which is of great significance to unifying all Party members in thinking, addressing prominent problems within the Party, maintaining a close bond with the people, and advancing the cause of the Party and the country.\n4. Major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics injects positive energy into turbulent world\nThe China-Central Asia Summit and the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation were held in May and October, respectively, in Xi'an and Beijing, as two of a series of diplomatic events hosted by China that Xi attended over the year. Xi also visited Russia, South Africa, the United States and Vietnam, where he held meetings, attended international conferences and engaged in bilateral and multilateral head-of-state diplomacy.\nIn March, China established diplomatic relations with Honduras, making it the 182nd country that has diplomatic relations with China; on the Ukraine issue, China has been promoting peace talks; China facilitated the historic reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran; on the Palestine-Israel conflict, China has upheld an objective and just position and played a constructive role.\nAs major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics makes solid progress, the external environment for China's development keeps improving.\nAt the end of the year, the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs was held, making comprehensive plans for China's external work for the present and coming periods.\n5. Sci-tech innovation forges new drivers, advantages for development\nOn May 28, C919, China's self-developed large passenger aircraft, completed its first commercial flight. Over the year, the Long March series carrier rockets fulfilled its 500th successful flight mission; the construction of China's space station was fully completed, and it entered a new phase of application and development; Chinese scientists unveiled a quantum computer prototype named \"Jiuzhang 3.0;\" Chinese expedition teams wrapped up the 13th Arctic Ocean scientific expedition, and embarked on the country's 40th Antarctic expedition.\nWith the breakthroughs, China sped up the integration of its resources for sci-tech innovation, and its strategic emerging industries are experiencing strong momentum, with a new type of productive force rising rapidly.\n6. All-out efforts on disaster relief and post-disaster reconstruction\nIn late July and early August, extreme rainfall hit northern and northeastern China, causing floods and geological disasters. On Dec. 18, a 6.2-magnitude earthquake jolted a county in northwest China's Gansu Province, inflicting heavy casualties.\nXi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, was deeply concerned about the affected people, attached great importance to disaster relief and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction work, and made important instructions, urging local authorities to do their utmost to ensure the safety of people's lives and property, and restore the normal order of production and life in the disaster-hit regions as soon as possible.\nAll relevant parties in the regions spared no effort on disaster relief, with the affected people actively carrying out self-rescue, jointly building a solid line of defense to protect their homes.\n7. China successfully hosts Chengdu Universiade, Hangzhou Asian Games\nChina hosted the 31st summer edition of the FISU World University Games, the 19th Asian Games and the 4th Asian Para Games successively in Chengdu and Hangzhou between July and October.\nXi attended the opening ceremonies of the FISU World University Games and the Asian Games, declaring the events open.\nChina earnestly delivered on its solemn pledge to make the international sports events a success, promoting exchanges and mutual learning and making new contributions to the cause of international youth sports and the Olympic Movement in Asia and the world at large.\n8. Xi Jinping Thought on Culture formally put forward\nAt a national meeting on the work of public communication and culture, held from Oct. 7 to 8, Xi Jinping Thought on Culture was formally put forward, marking a new height of the Party's confidence in history and culture.\nSpeaking at a meeting on cultural inheritance and development on June 2, Xi specified efforts in 14 areas to promote cultural development, put forward important ideas such as upholding the Party's leadership over culture-related work and shouldering new cultural missions, and announced a major task of building a modern Chinese civilization.\n9. Central financial work conference puts forward goal of building a nation with a strong financial sector\nAt the central financial work conference held in Beijing from Oct. 30 to 31, Xi reviewed the financial work since the 18th CPC National Congress, analyzed the situations facing high-quality development of the financial sector, and arranged relevant work for the current and future periods.\nThe conference called for accelerating the building of a nation with a strong financial sector, contributing to building China into a strong country and advancing national rejuvenation through high-quality financial development, raising the financial work to a higher strategic level.\nSince the beginning of this year, the financial industry has effectively supported the steady growth of the real economy, resolutely maintained the bottom line of preventing systemic financial risks, and strongly supported overall economic and social development.\n10. Chinese economy rebounds, solid progress achieved on high-quality development\nSince the beginning of this year, with the smooth transition of epidemic prevention and control, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has united and led the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups in withstanding external pressure, overcoming internal difficulties, comprehensively deepening reform and opening up, increasing macro-control efforts, and facilitating the growth of the private sector.\nThrough these efforts, the Chinese economy has rebounded for the better, high-quality development has been solidly advanced, important progress has been made in the construction of a modern industrial system, and the foundation for safe development has been consolidated. The GDP in the first three quarters of 2023 increased by 5.2 percent year on year, the total grain output has reached a new high, residents' income has grown faster than the economy, and the main expected goals of economic and social development have been successfully achieved.\nThe Central Economic Work Conference held in December deepened the understanding of the rules for better economic work in the new era. It was emphasized at the conference that next year China must seek progress while maintaining stability, faithfully implement the new development philosophy on all fronts, and effectively improve the quality of our economy and promote its growth within a reasonable range.  ■"

    "content": "BEIJING, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) -- As the year 2023 draws to a close, here are the key takeaways from Chinese President Xi Jinping's diplomacy throughout the year.\nIt has been a busy year for Xi with four trips abroad, dozens of meetings with foreign dignitaries, chairing the first China-Central Asia Summit and attending the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, and more.\nFOSTERING COOPERATION WITH MAJOR COUNTRIES\nOn March 20, Xi embarked on a state visit to Russia. This was his first trip abroad after his reelection as Chinese president. He described this trip as a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace.\nNoting that China and Russia are each other's biggest neighbor, Xi said that consolidating and developing long-term good-neighborly relations with Russia is consistent with historical logic and a strategic choice of China, which will not be changed by any turn of events.\nIn the first 11 months of this year, the bilateral trade between China and Russia achieved the annual trade volume target of 200 billion U.S. dollars jointly set by the two heads of state, which shows the strong resilience and broad prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries.\nOn July 20, Xi met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who made his final visit to China four months before passing away at the age of 100. The meeting took place at Villa 5 of the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, the venue where Kissinger had met with Premier Zhou Enlai during his first visit to China. Kissinger will always be remembered and missed by the Chinese people, Xi said in a message of condolences to U.S. President Joe Biden on the death of the statesman.\nThe captivating China-U.S. summit took place on Nov. 15 at Filoli Estate, a country house south of San Francisco. During the four-hour-long meeting, the Chinese president noted that being at the helm of China-U.S. relations, he and President Biden shoulder heavy responsibilities for the two peoples, for the world and for history.\nThe two presidents agreed to promote and strengthen bilateral dialogue and cooperation in such areas as China-U.S. government talks on AI and the establishment of a working group on counternarcotics cooperation. They agreed to resume high-level communication between the two militaries, work toward a significant further increase in scheduled passenger flights early next year, and expand various bilateral exchanges in education, overseas students, youth, culture, sports and between the business communities.\nThere were light moments too. Ahead of a banquet, Biden showed Xi a photo from his phone, a picture of Xi taken with the Golden Gate Bridge, when he made his maiden trip to the United States in 1985 as a county leader of Zhengding in China's northern province of Hebei. Biden praised Xi's Hongqi limousine \"beautiful\" when parting with the Chinese leader, and Xi gestured the staff to open the door of the made-in-China car for Biden to take a better look.\nXi also had frequent exchanges with European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen.\nAmid the increasingly turbulent international situation, the China-EU relationship has strategic significance and implications for global peace, stability and prosperity, said Xi when meeting with the EU leaders in Beijing in December.\nSTANDING WITH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\nMost of the foreign dignitaries Xi met were from developing countries, reflecting China's diplomatic principle that all countries, big or small, are equal.\nDuring his state visit to South Africa from Aug. 21 to 24, Xi co-chaired with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa the China-Africa Leaders' Dialogue. Xi announced China's three initiatives on supporting Africa's industrialization, agricultural modernization and talent development.\nXi also attended the 15th BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, where six countries were invited to become new BRICS members.\nXi said that the BRICS expansion is historic and a new starting point for BRICS cooperation. He stressed that the expansion reflects the resolution of the BRICS countries to unite and cooperate with other developing countries, meets the expectations of the international community, and serves the common interests of emerging markets and developing countries.\nOn Sept. 21, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad arrived in Hangzhou, capital city of east China's Zhejiang Province, to attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games. When meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Xi said China supports Syria in opposing foreign interference, rejecting unilateralism and bullying, and safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, adding that China supports Syria in conducting reconstruction.\nIn addition, Xi hosted in June Iris Xiomara Castro Sarmiento, the first Honduran president to pay a state visit to China since China and Honduras established diplomatic relations in March. Xi told Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro Moros in September that China supports Venezuela in setting up special economic zones and will share relevant experience to help its national development. Xi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in April witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents on trade and investment, digital economy, scientific and technological innovation and other areas.\nGROWING NEIGHBORHOOD DIPLOMACY\nOn May 19, Xi chaired the first China-Central Asia Summit in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, a new milestone in China-Central Asia relations. Xi said central Asian countries are welcome to board the \"express train\" of China's development. He made an eight-point proposal for strengthening cooperation, ranging from expanding economic ties to promoting cultural exchanges and safeguarding regional peace.\nOn Oct. 17, the Chinese and Indonesian heads of state jointly inaugurated the official operation of the Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway. It is the first high-speed railway in Southeast Asia, cutting the journey between the two cities from over three hours to around 40 minutes.\nNoting that the Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway is a \"golden brand\" for the Belt and Road cooperation between the two countries, Xi said China is willing to work with Indonesia to sum up successful experience, make sound efforts in its high-quality operation and foster an economic belt along the railway.\nXi paid a state visit to Vietnam from Dec. 12 to 13, and was received with the highest diplomatic protocol of Vietnam. Both sides agreed to build a China-Vietnam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance, a major historic decision made by the leaders of the two parties and countries, as well as the most important political achievement reached by the two sides.\nBefore concluding his visit, Xi noted that what impressed him most was General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong's repeated emphasis that the China-Vietnam bond of \"camaraderie plus brotherhood\" is the starting point and foundation of the China-Vietnam relationship.\nThis year marks the 10th anniversary of principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy proposed by Xi. He wrote in a signed article in the Nhan Dan Newspaper of Vietnam that \"Asia is our common home. Neighboring countries cannot be moved away. Helping one's neighbor is helping oneself, and good neighbors wish each other well.\"\nBUILDING A COMMUNITY WITH A SHARED FUTURE FOR HUMANITY\nAnother landmark in China's diplomacy is mediating talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Both countries agreed to restore diplomatic relations and reopen their embassies and missions within two months after their talks concluded in Beijing on March 10. A joint trilateral statement said the decision for China to host the talks was based on the agreement between Xi and the leaderships of Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nDuring his state visit to Russia in March, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin had an in-depth exchange of views on the Ukraine issue. Xi stressed that a review of history shows that conflicts in the end have to be settled through dialogue and negotiation. For his part, Putin said Russia has carefully studied China's position paper on the political settlement of the Ukraine issue and is open to talks for peace.\nOn April 26, Xi spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky over the phone. Xi said China will send a special representative of the Chinese government on Eurasian affairs to visit Ukraine and other countries to conduct in-depth communication with all parties on the political settlement of the crisis. Zelensky welcomed China's important role in restoring peace and seeking diplomatic solution to the crisis.\nXi attended the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestinian-Israeli issue on Nov. 21. The Chinese president emphasized that the only viable way to break the cycle of Palestinian-Israeli conflict lies in the two-state solution, in the restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine, and in the establishment of an independent State of Palestine.\nAs the Belt and Road Initiative turns 10 years old this year, Xi announced at the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRF) eight major steps China will take to support high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. The high-profile forum, held in Beijing from Oct. 17 to 18, is the most important diplomatic event hosted by China this year.\nOver the past decade, Xi has proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative in succession, contributing wisdom and strength to building a community with a shared future for humanity.  ■"

    "content": "BEIJING, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- After some setbacks on the post-COVID 19 recovery path, the Chinese economy has once again shown its resilience and great potential as it regained momentum in the third quarter, expanding by a higher-than-expected 5.2 percent.\nAgainst the backdrop of multiple uncertainties in the global economy, many international institutions have recently upgraded China's economic growth forecasts, with the figures for 2023 all above 5 percent. Some analysts have predicted an even higher growth for 2024.\nThese positive signs, which came as a result of a series of forceful and pragmatic policies and measures implemented by the Chinese government to stabilize growth and promote an opening-up, have not only given the world a great boost of confidence, but also once again proved the vicious \"China collapse\" rhetoric wrong.\nSince the beginning of this year, the global economy has been struggling under the impact of geopolitical crises, the spillover effect of the U.S. fiscal and monetary policies, and the so-called \"de-risking\" of supply chains by some Western countries.\nThe Chinese economy has also met with many challenges: persistent global inflationary pressure, a deteriorating trade environment, and sluggish international market demand, among others. To overcome the difficulties, China has given priority to stability while pursuing progress, rolling out a comprehensive package of macro-control policies.\nSince the second quarter, the United Nations has taken the lead in raising China's economic growth forecast for this year. Recently after the release of the faster-than-expected figures for the third quarter, more institutions have followed suit.\nIn its mid-year update of the World Economic Situation and Prospects 2023, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs raised its forecast for China's economic growth this year to 5.3 percent from 4.8 at the beginning of the year. The International Monetary Fund recently announced that it expects China's economy to grow by 5.4 percent in 2023, higher than previously expected. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development raised the figure to 5.2 percent from 5 percent. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast to 5.1 percent from 4.8-4.9 percent. Citigroup raised its forecast to 5.3 percent from 5 percent.\nThese bullish predictions have a solid basis. Figures from the National Statistics Office show that China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.2 percent year-on-year in the first three quarters of this year, one of the fastest among major economies in the world. From January to October, 41,947 new foreign-invested enterprises were established in China, up 32.1 percent year on year. The actual investment in China by Canada, Britain, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands increased by 110.3 percent, 94.6 percent, 90.0 percent, 66.1 percent and 33.0 percent, respectively.\nMarcos Pires, director of the Institute of Economics and International Studies at Sao Paulo State University in Brazil, said that China's economy is not only growing steadily, but also improving in quality. China's clean energy sector, driven by the rapid development of new energy power generation equipment, battery and electric vehicle industries, \"has become the undisputed leader in the world in just a few years.\"\nThe accelerating recovery of the Chinese economy pronounced the failure of the so-called \"de-coupling\" or \"de-risking\" tricks by some Western politicians. They might create a temporary headwind down the road, but China's vigorous economic development and its mutually-beneficial cooperation with the outside world won't be stopped.\n\"Since the beginning of this year, the media and politicians of some Western countries, including the United States, have said that China's economy is about to collapse, that China's economy is a time bomb, and that Chinese cities have become ghost cities,\" said renowned Australian economist Guo Shengxiang. \"These statements are pompous and out of touch with common sense.\"\nChina's economy has its own cycle, and the main direction is \"upward,\" Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University in the United States, said. In the next 30 years, China will be a leader in digital technology, electric vehicles, renewable energy and many other fields of science and technology, he told Xinhua.\nThis year marks the 45th anniversary of China's opening-up policy. In recent years, China has been intensifying moves to promote a high-quality opening-up, setting up more and greater platforms for win-win cooperation for all parties, and earning more trust from the international community.\nChina applies the highest standards in implementing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, and has taken proactive steps to align its economic and trade rules with the high standards of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Digital Economic Partnership Agreement, improved the mechanism for protecting the rights and interests of foreign investment, further reduced the negative list for foreign investment access, and worked hard to break down barriers that restrict the flow of innovation factors.\nMore and more business people around the world are now assured of China's steadfast determination and capability to continuously push forward its opening-up and sincerity in contributing to global development from a win-win approach. The \"next China\" is still China, they say. \"Investing in China is investing in the future,\" they also say.\n\"China's commitment to high-level openness will benefit the entire world,\" said Jim Rogers, a world-renowned investor and financial commentator.\nIndeed, the institutional advantages of the socialist market economy, the strengths of its enormous market, the supply advantages of a full-fledged industrial system, and the talent advantages of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs are the basis for China's economy to forge ahead, and have been increasingly recognized by the outside world.\n\"China is now the economically indispensable nation in the world,\" said Khairy Tourk, professor of Economics at Illinois Institute of Technology.\nAlthough there will be various setbacks and difficulties on the way forward, China has chosen the right development path and direction, and promoting a high-level opening-up will make China one of the most important and successful countries in the world in the 21st century, said Rogers.  ■"
